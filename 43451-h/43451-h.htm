<p class="first address">Sir,</p>
<p>Reiterated Favours claim a Repetition of Acknowledgments; should the
latter be as frequent as the former, they might prove rather
troublesome to you, than acceptable. I have therefore resolv&rsquo;d
once for all to express how sensible I am of the many Obligations I lye
under. You would not perhaps be pleas&rsquo;d, should I go about to
enumerate them, because great Minds never look back upon what
Courtesies they have bestow&rsquo;d, being always intent upon what
farther Acts of Generosity they may perform.</p>
<p>Among the many other Testimonies of your Bounty, there is one I am
here oblig&rsquo;d particularly to mention, which is your having
admitted of the Dedication of so small a Work as the Translation of
<i>Cieza&rsquo;s</i> Travels in <i>Peru</i>. Your Acceptance of that
Part has encourag&rsquo;d me to prefix your Name to the Whole, now
grown up into two Volumes, that it may honour them both in the Front,
as it gives Reputation to the first in that Place, where it shall
remain as a Demonstration of your Condescension, as this is of your
Right and my Gratitude. I shall therefore avoid any Repetition of what
is there said, or adding more here to display your Merit. Neither am I
capable of giving your Character, nor will you consent to it, which
puts me upon a Necessity of cutting short; lest my own Inclination and
your Desert insensibly draw me on to attempt what I am not
qualify&rsquo;d to go through with. True Virtue can be no more
conceal&rsquo;d than the Splendor of the Sun, nor does it stand in need
of outward Ornaments to set it off; you have render&rsquo;d your self
too conspicuous to be unknown, and can receive no Addition from my poor
Endeavours. The Design of these Lines is, at the same Time, to honour
my Work with your Patronage, and to express my Acknowledgment and
Gratitude for all Favours already receiv&rsquo;d; wishing this may
stand a perpetual Monument of both, and to you all Increase of
Happiness; and I shall always own my self</p>
<p class="signed">Sir,</p>
<p class="signed">Your most Obliged, and most</p>
<p class="signed">Devoted Humble Servant</p>

<span class="xd21e261">Advertisement</span><br>
Concerning this Work in general.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It will be needless to trouble the Reader with a
tedious Introduction, shewing the usefulness of this sort of Books,
several others having already treated of that Subject, no less
Learnedly than Fully, so that it would only be repeating what has been
frequently said already, and what most Men are sufficiently
convinc&rsquo;d of; besides that, it is not design&rsquo;d to fill up
this small Volume with Perswasives to buy it; but rather to proceed
directly to the matter propos&rsquo;d. But, lest the Design should be
misapprehended, it will be necessary, in as few Words as may be, to
make all Persons sensible of it. Nothing is more certain, than that
many curious Pieces have escap&rsquo;d the search of those who have
publish&rsquo;d Volumes of this Nature, either because they are grown
extreamly Rare; or, perhaps, those who Translated were not Masters of
the Languages in which they were Writ, or else for want of sufficient
Information; since, as no Man can know all Things, neither can any be
acquainted with all Books. These are the Things now design&rsquo;d to
Entertain the Publick, with assurance that nothing shall be
offer&rsquo;d, but what is valuable, and approv&rsquo;d of by Learned
and Ingenious Persons. It is needless, and even impracticable, in this
First Part to give a Catalogue of the Books intended to be Translated;
needless, in Regard that being very rare, few are yet acquainted with
them; and impracticable, because several not yet known to the
Undertakers, may hereafter come to Hand: As also, by reason that some
which are not to be found in <i>England</i>, are now sent for Abroad,
and considering their Scarcity, and the Hazards of the Sea, it is
impossible to determine when they will be had. Besides, it is not
convenient to Publish the Names of such Books, at a time when so many
are gaping to catch at any thing they can hope to make an Advantage of,
tho&rsquo; others have acquir&rsquo;d some sort of right to it, by
declaring they have such a Work in Hand. Every Piece that is
Publish&rsquo;d, will, it is hop&rsquo;d, Recommend it self, and be an
Inducement to the Buyer to purchase the next, for which reason it will
be superfluous to add any thing in their Commendation. Neither is this
Work confin&rsquo;d to Translations, the Undertakers having already a
prospect of some Original Manuscripts of the same Nature, Written by
Ingenious and Able Persons, who have Travel&rsquo;d, and not taken care
to publish their Observations. The Translations will be out of all
Languages, which can afford any thing answerable to what is proposed,
that is, excellent in it self, and never before seen in
<i>English</i>.</p>
<p>As for the Method here intended, it is to Publish every Month, as
much as will make a Book of Twelve Pence, or Eighteen Pence, according
as it can be contriv&rsquo;d, without breaking off abruptly, to leave
the Relation maim&rsquo;d and imperfect, for as scarce any of the Books
to be Translated are so small as to come into the compass of a Month,
so of necessity they must be divided into several Parts, according to
their Bulk. Now each Month being Sold Stich&rsquo;d, every Buyer may
afterwards Bind them up when he has an Author compleat, and therefore
great care shall be taken, that the one may end, and the next begin, so
as to cause no Obstacle, or Confusion in Binding. All the Books shall
be adorn&rsquo;d with proper Maps, and useful Cuts, that is, not with
Representations of Battels, or Draughts of Places made according to the
Engravers Fancy, but with true Delineations taken upon the Spot, where
any such are to be had; the real Habits of the People; Birds, Beasts,
Plants, <i>&amp;c.</i> Whether every Month will afford any of these,
cannot be promised, since they are to be inserted in their proper
Places, for substantial Information, and not dispers&rsquo;d at Will to
embellish the Book, and divert the Ignorant. Therefore some Months will
contain more, others fewer, and some perhaps none, with assurance that
the Charge shall not be spar&rsquo;d where they are requisite, and such
are to be had as can be vouch&rsquo;d to be Genuine. Thus every Person
will, at so small a Price, as has been mention&rsquo;d have a Taste of
the Author propos&rsquo;d to be Translated, and of the Performance,
before he launches out more Money to purchase the whole, and has every
Month something New to Divert and Inform; which, tho&rsquo; at first it
may look slight, as being a Stitch&rsquo;d Pamphlet, will soon grow
upon into a Compleat Work, as if Printed all at once, and be no less
becoming any Gentlemans Study, or Library. No Author is design&rsquo;d
to be Abridg&rsquo;d, but fairly, and carefully Translated at large;
but if any should hereafter be thought fit, for any particular Reasons
to be so dealt with, it shall not be done without the Advice and
Approbation of sufficient Judges, and the Publick shall have Notice of
it, that no Man may have just cause to Complain he is any way
Impos&rsquo;d on. Every Author shall have a particular Preface giving
some Account of Him, and his Work, with a fair Title, for the Binding
of him up conveniently into a Volume, and every Month, as has been
said, so contriv&rsquo;d, that there may be no Casma, or other Eyesore
in the Book. A small number will be Printed on a large fine Paper, for
such as are more Curious, at one half more than the Price of the Common
Sort.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>Our Author</i>, Bartholomew Leonardo de Argensola,
<i>was a Learned Clergyman, and as such employ&rsquo;d by the President
and Council of the</i> Indies <i>to Write this History. He calls
it</i>, The Conquest of the <i>Molucco</i> Islands, <i>without
Enlarging any further in his title, tho&rsquo; at the same time his
Work contains their first Discovery, their Description, the Manners,
Customs, Religion, Habit, and Political and Natural History; with all
the Wars, and other Remarkable Accidents in those Parts, since they
were first known to</i> Europeans, <i>till their Reduction under the
Crown of Spain. In Speaking of them he Occasionally runs out to give
the same Account of the</i> Philippine <i>Islands, and of several
others in those Eastern Seas. This is frequent in</i> Spanish <i>Books,
wherein we generally find much more than the Titles promise, contrary
to what is Practis&rsquo;d with us, who strive to fill up a Title Page
with abundance of Inviting Heads, the least part whereof is Treated of
in the Body of the Work, or at best so Superficially, that scarce any
more can be made of them there, than was in the Frontispiece.</i></p>
<p><i>For the Compiling of this Work the Author, being Employ&rsquo;d
by the Authority abovemention&rsquo;d, had the Command of all
Authentick Manuscript Relations, which were either in the Kings
Custody, or in Private Hands; besides the Testimony of such Persons
then Living, as had been Eye-Witnesses to any part of what he delivers.
His Design was only to Write the Conquest of those Islands, by King</i>
Philip <i>the Third of</i> Spain; <i>but considering how few were
acquainted with them, and that of Consequence most Readers would be at
a loss to know where, or what these</i> Moluccos <i>were, he
Judiciously Resolv&rsquo;d to bring down his History from its proper
Source. To this End he begins with the Antient, and Fabulous Original
of their Kings; then comes to the Discovery of them by</i> Europeans,
<i>and proceeds to the Wars between them, and with the Natives, for the
Possession of those so much coveted Dominions.</i></p>
<p><i>His Description of them is very Exact; That of the Cloves, their
principal Commodity, no less Curious; and that of the other Product and
Animals, Inferior to neither. The Wars carrying him over from one Place
to another; he gives a short Account of the Islands</i> Pap&ucirc;as,
<i>and that of</i> Celebes. <i>The</i> Spaniards, <i>to avoid passing
through the</i> Portuguese <i>Sea, attempted to settle Trade at the</i>
Moluccos, <i>by the way of the Streights of</i> Magellan, <i>which
gives occasion to</i> Argensola <i>to entertain us with a particular
Account of the</i> Spanish <i>Fleet sent into the said Streight, under
the Admiral</i> Sarmiento, <i>which has been hitherto very Imperfectly
Deliver&rsquo;d in</i> English, <i>tho&rsquo; very Remarkable, and full
of Surprizing Accidents. In short, not to stretch out this Preface,
with the Subject of the Work, we shall find in it a brief Description
of the Island</i> Sumatra; <i>of the vast Empire of</i> China; <i>of
all the</i> Philippine <i>Islands, and those of</i> Ceylon, Banda,
Java, <i>and many others of less Note. Nor does he omit to speak of
the</i> Dutch <i>Voyages; and Undertakings of Sir</i> Francis Drake,
<i>and other English Adventurers; and Embelishes the whole with such
variety of pleasing Incidents, that few Books of Travels afford so much
Profitable Entertainment, with such good Authority.</i></p>
<p><i>No Author ever had a better Reputation, among all that
Understand, and have had the good Fortune to Meet with him; for being
so Valuable, he is extraordinary Scarce, rare to be met with in</i>
Spain, <i>and consequently much more in</i> England. <i>This may
perhaps be the main Reason why he has not yet been Translated, and
being so Valuable, he cannot miss of that Reception which he has found
in the Original. But it is not intended to prepossess the Reader, who
is left to make his own Judgment, and therefore a long Preface is
designedly avoided, that he may the sooner enter upon so Useful and
Diverting a Work. It is not improper, nevertheless, to Advise the
Reader not to take notice of some Reflections in Point of Religion, and
in other Cases, considering the Book was Writ by a</i> Spaniard, <i>and
that it was not proper to Omit, or Alter any thing, where a Fair, and
Entire Translation is promised. Besides, That these are very few, and
inconsiderable, and consequently not worth observing, as indeed the
generality of Judicious Readers will be suffciently satisfy&rsquo;d,
and this Caution is given for their Sake, whom perhaps Passion, or
overmuch Zeal may move to condem a Work on such an Occasion, when they
can find no other matter to Carp at.</i></p>

Introduction.</i></span> I write the Conquest of the <i>Molucco</i>
Islands by King <i>Philip</i> the III. of <i>Spain</i>, and the
reducing of their Kings to their former Subjection, to his
Predecessors, by Don <i>Pedro de Acunha</i>, Governour of the
<i>Philippine</i> Islands, and Admiral of the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet; a
Victory worthy the Foresight of such a Godly Monarch, the Application
of those worthy Statesmen that compose his supreme Council, and the
Valour of our Nation; not so much on account of the Wealth, and
Fertility of those Countries, as for that it took from the Northern
Nations all occasion of Sailing in our Seas, and Debauching the new
Converted <i>Asiaticks</i>, and the Inhabitants of our Colonies Trading
among them. The Celerity with which the Expedition was concluded, does
not in the least diminish the Glory of the Event; which, for that very
Reason, might rather deserve a place in a more ample Relation. I am
sensible of the Dangers I expose my self to; but am no less
satisfy&rsquo;d, that I shall find some to stand by me. The most famous
Painters, and Carvers, have generally a great value for Heads, Arms,
and other Limbs, which have been drawn to perfection from the Life, by
which they compose all the Parts, when they design some excellent
Piece. The ignorant in those Arts have no Esteem for such Fragments,
being only taken with the entire Statue, or Picture, consisting of all
its Limbs, without examining the Defects there may be in each of them.
The Relation I undertake to write of these Islands will find the same
Esteem, and be expos&rsquo;d to no less Contempt; for the Judicious,
who understand <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name=
"pb2">2</a>]</span>how History is Compil&rsquo;d, will value this part
drawn to the Life; whereas those, who, as they say themselves, Read
only to divert the Time, will make little account of it, as being more
fond of some Romance, full of Monsterous Events; or of some bulkey
Work, bearing the Title of a History, treating of numerous Armies, and
mighty Slaughters, and bestowing the Success, not where Providence
gave, but where they would have it. This is the Reason why many Things,
worthy to be known and preserv&rsquo;d, remain bury&rsquo;d in
Oblivion; because being left for General Histories, there are only
slight Sketches of them Drawn at the Time when they hapned, by those
who had a share in them, so that when these Manuscripts are to be made
use of, either they are not to be found, or else they reduce the Writer
to a necessity of subscribing to whatsoever either Self-Love, or any
other Passion dictated to the Authors of such Memoirs, without any
possibility of examining into the Truth. To obviate this Inconveniency,
in a matter of such moment as that of <i>Ternate</i>, the Capital of
the <i>Molucco</i> Islands, I was Commanded to write an Account of it,
at a time when they were still living who acted in and directed it: And
I have such full Information of all that is requisite for this purpose,
that I hope Truth will make amends for my want of Ability. This is as
much as I have thought fit to Advertise the Reader, without entering
upon the Advantage he will reap by perusing this Relation; because, if
he is well affected, all I can say for it will be superfluous; and if
otherwise inclin&rsquo;d, tho&rsquo; I endeavour to set him right, he
will never conceive it.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Kings of the</i> Moluccos.</span> Among
the fourteen most potent Princes, who Lord it over the
<i>Archipelago</i> of the <i>Molucco</i> Islands, under the Title of
Kings, those of <i>Ternate</i> and <i>Tydore</i> boast of a Divine
Original; such Liberty to be vain do Men take upon them, or so much do
they ascribe to obscure Antiquity. <span class="marginnote"><i>A Fable
of their Original.</i></span> There is an ancient Tradition among those
People, look&rsquo;d upon as Sacred, That they were once Govern&rsquo;d
by a most Ancient Prince, called <i>Bicocigara</i>, who sailing along
the Coast of <i>Rachian</i>, perceiv&rsquo;d that among some craggy
Rocks there were grown up abundance of <i>Rotas</i>, so they call a
sort of solid Canes, which, when small, they make use of instead of
Ropes. He lik&rsquo;d them, and order&rsquo;d they should be cut down,
and brought into his Vessel. His Subjects going to fulfil his Orders,
and having search&rsquo;d all the place, return&rsquo;d to their
Master, desiring he would look again, least his Eyes deceiv&rsquo;d
him, for they could meet with no such Canes. <i>Bicocigara</i>, who saw
them distinctly from his Boat, was positive with his incredulous
People, and order&rsquo;d them again to be brought; but to decide the
matter, went himself Ashore, where immediatly they appeared to them
all. He commanded them to be cut down, and as they went about it, Blood
ran from the Canes that were cut. Being astonish&rsquo;d at that
Prodigy, he discover&rsquo;d close to the Roots of them four Eggs,
which look&rsquo;d like a Snakes Eggs, and at the same time heard a
Voice, proceeding from the hollow of the Canes cut down, which said,
<i>Keep those Eggs; for from them shall come four excellent
Governours</i>. He took up those fatal Eggs, with Religious Respect,
and carry&rsquo;d them home, where they were kept in the best place of
his House. In a short time, from the four Yolks proceeded four Rational
Chickens, being three Men, and one Woman, who afterwards Reign&rsquo;d,
the first of them <i>Bachian</i>, the second in <i>Butan</i>, and the
third over the Islands call&rsquo;d <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3"
href="#pb3" name="pb3">3</a>]</span><i>Papuas</i>, lying East from the
<i>Moluccos</i>. The Woman was Marry&rsquo;d to Prince <i>Loloda</i>,
who gave Name to the Country of <i>Batochina</i>, not far from the
great <i>Boconora</i>. This Fable has gain&rsquo;d such Reputation,
that they honour <i>Bicocigara</i> as a Hero, worship the Rocks, and
adore the Eggs. The truth of it is, that the cunning Man, by this
prodigious Superstition, Sanctify&rsquo;d his own Race, and
gain&rsquo;d Kingdoms, and Respect for his four Children. So
<i>Greece</i> feign&rsquo;d, or beleiv&rsquo;d, that <i>Leda</i>
Conceiving of the Adulterous Swan brought forth the Eggs, from which
came <i>Castor</i>, <i>Pollux</i>, and <i>Helena</i>. Fortune, when she
raises Men to a high pitch, perswades those she designs to Crown, to
lay the Foundation of their Majesty on Fables, resembling true
Misteries, so to perswade the Multitude that they are somewhat Divine,
and to distinguish the Royal Race by a peculiarity even in the
Universal Law of being Born into the World. Of this Race thirteen
Idolatrous Kings succeeded one another in <i>Tydore</i>, down to Sultan
<i>Tydore Bongue</i>, the first that receiv&rsquo;d the
<i>Mahometan</i> Alcoran, tho&rsquo; intermix&rsquo;d with Idolatry,
which lasted above Eighty Years, and being confounded among the
Precepts of that abominable Sect, bred Divisions, and Distractions
among the People. Afterwards, when the Commander <i>Brito</i>
arriv&rsquo;d in that Island, as we shall soon see, he found a
<i>Caciz</i>, or Priest, taught them the new Superstition, and that
many oppos&rsquo;d him, on account of the old Fable of the Eggs, which
the <i>Persian Morabout</i> could never Decry; so great is the power of
Error transmitted from our Fore-Fathers.</p>
<p>King <i>Tydore Bongue</i>&rsquo;s Successor, was his Son <i>Cachil
Boleyfe</i>, no less <span class="marginnote"><i>A false
Prophesie.</i></span>Supersticious than the Father, but in another way.
He pretending to the Spirit of Prophecy, gain&rsquo;d such Reputation,
by the Experience and Foresight of his Riper Years, that he came to be
Honour&rsquo;d by his Subjects as a Prophet; or by the least Credulous,
as a Person of singular Prudence, so that all Men gave Ear to him, as
to an Oracle. Puffed up with this Vanity, he pretended to Fore-tell
future Events; which when no particular Persons, or set Times are
appointed, is a safe way of Predicting, without Danger of being found
False; either because in process of Time something Accidentally
happens, that may be adapted to the Prophecy, or in regard, that is
always expected which will never come to pass. For this Reason, as in
most Countries there are some current Notions of future Expectations,
conceiv&rsquo;d upon trivial Occasions, rather than any Observation of
the Stars; therefore <i>Boleyfe</i> us&rsquo;d to tell those about him,
That the time would come, when Iron Men should arrive at
<i>Ternate</i>, from the remotest parts of the World, and settle in its
Territory; by whose Power the Glory, and Dominion of the <i>Molucco</i>
Islands should be far extended.</p>
<p>In the Reign of King <i>John</i> the first, of <i>Portugal</i>, his
Son, Prince <i>Henry</i>, <span class="marginnote"><i>First
Discoveries.</i></span> having employ&rsquo;d several Persons on
Discoveries, <i>John Gonzales</i>, and <i>Tristan Vaz</i> found the
Island of <i>Madera</i>, in the Year 1419, and others soon after those
of the <i>Azores</i>, and <i>Cabo Verde</i>, and ran along the Coast of
<i>Guinea</i> and <i>Africk</i>. Afterwards, in the Reigns of King
<i>Edward</i>, and <i>Alonso</i> the V. those Discoveries were
continu&rsquo;d, till under King <i>John</i> the II. they proceeded as
far as the Cape of <i>Good Hope</i>, and a Hundred Leagues beyond it,
along the Coast, call&rsquo;d <i>Rio del Infante</i>. The honour of
this Discovery is due to that famous Seaman <i>Bartholomew Diaz</i>, if
we may believe the Manuscript Memoirs of <i>Duarte Resende</i>, for the
Historian <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name=
"pb4">4</a>]</span><i>Barros</i>. This rais&rsquo;d Emulation in the
<i>Spanish</i> Nation, already engag&rsquo;d in such Voyages, as having
Discover&rsquo;d the Western Islands, call&rsquo;d <i>Antilles</i>, or
<i>Caribbee</i> Islands. This Discovery occasion&rsquo;d a Controversy
about the Right to them, <i>Portugal</i> pretending to, and
<i>Spain</i> defending its Possession. After much Contention, the
Difference was adjusted by <i>Ruy de Sousa</i>, and <i>Don John</i> his
Son, and <i>Arias de Almada</i>, Commission&rsquo;d by <i>Portugal</i>,
who in the Year 1404. agreed with the <i>Spanish</i> Embassador, That,
since this inferior Globe, consisting of Earth and Water, answers to
the Degrees into which the Celestial Sphere is divided, it should be
equally parted between the two Kings, by a Meridian Line drawn through
the North and South Poles, and compassing the Land and Sea, so as to
cut them into two halves. It was appointed, That the Share to the
Eastward should belong to the Crown of <i>Portugal</i>, and the other
to the Westward, to that of <i>Castile</i>; and that it should be so
mark&rsquo;d down on the Sea Charts; the Line passing through a fixt
Point on the Earth, which was to be the Boundary of both Nations. This
was by mutual Consent settled 360 Leagues West from <i>Cabo Verde</i>,
and so the Line, or Meridian, fell upon the Country we call
<i>Brazil</i>, about the most Westerly part of the Mouth of the River
<i>Maranhao</i>, which disembogues there to the Northward. This Line
cuts through that Country, and to the Southward runs off beyond the
River of <i>Plate</i>, from whence the <i>Spaniards</i> begin to reckon
their Degrees of Longitude Westward, and the <i>Portugueses</i>
Eastward, 180 belonging to each of them, for as much as the whole
Circumference of the Earth contains three hundred and sixty
Degrees.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Vasco de Gama <i>discovers</i>

<i>Emanuel</i> of <i>Portugal</i>, to Discover and Conquer
<i>India</i>, prosecuted this Enterprize, look&rsquo;d upon by
<i>Ptolomy</i>, as impracticable; he travers&rsquo;d the main Ocean,
within the <i>Portuguese</i> Division, where he Discover&rsquo;d, and
since the <i>Portuguese</i> Commanders have Conquer&rsquo;d so many
Kingdoms, Nations, and Islands, so distinct in Customs, Manners, Laws,
Languages, and Colours. They returning home admir&rsquo;d what they had
seen, and lay&rsquo;d it down in Maps, but stretching out the
Longitude, that is the Distance from West to East, beyond what it
really was; thus Craftily providing for the Controversy which might
arise upon this Occasion, as it soon happen&rsquo;d, through the
Falshood of the Sea Charts.</p>

<p><span class="marginnote">Portugueses <i>Pretentions to the</i>
Moluccos.</span>By virtue of this practice, and by the
<i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> subsequent Authorizing of it, the
<i>Portugueses</i> pretend that the <i>Molucco</i> Islands, and those
of <i>Banda</i>, and <i>Amboyna</i>, are within their Bounds, as they
were adjudg&rsquo;d, and settled by experienc&rsquo;d Sailers,
calculating the Extent of that Meridian, and they even stretch it 15
Degrees further. <i>Resende</i> complains, That <i>Magalhaens</i>, whom
the <i>English</i> call <i>Magellan</i>, magnify&rsquo;d the Opinion
conceiv&rsquo;d of the Eastern Seas, when in the Year 1519 he went away
Disgusted into <i>Spain</i>. <i>Magellan</i> grew up in the service of
Queen <i>Ellenor</i>, then serv&rsquo;d King <i>Emanuel</i>, and went
over into <i>India</i> with that <i>Alonso de Albuquerque</i>, of whose
Bravery, and Conduct, we have written Histories, besides what Fame, and
Tradition have deliver&rsquo;d. This Man, not satisfy&rsquo;d with the
first Conquests, sent <i>Antony de Abreu</i>, <i>Francis Serrano</i>,
and <i>Ferdinand de <span class="corr" id="xd21e840" title=
"Source: Nagalhaens">Magalhaens</span></i> from <i>Malaca</i>, with
three Ships, to Discover the <i>Molucco</i> Islands. All these three
Commanders steer&rsquo;d several Courses. We shall <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name="pb5">5</a>]</span>soon speak
of <i>Magellan</i> again. <i>Antony de Abreu</i> arriv&rsquo;d at
<i>Banda</i>, and returning towards <i>Malaca</i>, richly Laden with
Spice of that Country, <i>Serrano</i> was parted from him in a Storm,
and Shipwrack&rsquo;d on the Islands of <i>Lucopino</i>, signifying
Islands of <i>Tortoises</i>, so call&rsquo;d from the Plenty and
Bigness of those Creatures.</p>
<p>There the Tempest left the <i>Portugueses</i>, only their Lives and
Arms sav&rsquo;d, <span class="marginnote">Serrano <i>cast on the
Islands of</i> Lucopine.</span> for their <i>Junck</i>, which is a sort
of light Vessel, was Stav&rsquo;d. The <i>Lucopine</i> Islands were
Horrid, by reason of their want of Water, and being Desert; for their
Rocks lying under Water, and the many Sea Robbers that frequent them,
and always keep Sentinels posted to discover any Sailing by, that they
may fall upon, and plunder them. Had not Hunger and Thirst threatned
the <i>Portuguses</i> with speedy Death, they had reason to expect it
at the Hands of those Pyrats; but that which had been the Destruction
of others, at this time prov&rsquo;d their Safety. Those Miscreants had
observ&rsquo;d the Shipwreck, and Rowing up in a Vessel call&rsquo;d a
<i>Caracoa</i>, as it were to a certain Booty, drew near to those who
had so narrowly escap&rsquo;d perishing in the Sea; but the
<i>Malaca</i> Pilots, and Mariners were not ignorant of their design.
They acquainted their Captain with the Danger, desiring him to take
such Measures as might be for his own, and their Safety.
<i>Serrano</i>, like a Man of Valour and Discretion, having
view&rsquo;d the Shore, conceal&rsquo;d his Men in a hidden Place. The
Pyrates landed to pursue them; but as soon as ever they were at some
distance from the Shore, the Strangers rush&rsquo;d out, and
possess&rsquo;d themselves of the <i>Caracoa</i>. The Barbarians thus
surpris&rsquo;d, reflecting on their Mismanagement, and perceiving they
were lost Men, gave over the thoughts of Robbing, and had recourse to
Intreaties, throwing down their Bows and Arrows, and begging they would
not leave <span class="marginnote"><i>His Escape<span class="corr" id=
"xd21e909" title="Not in source">.</span></i></span> them in that
Island, but rather take pity, and pardon what they had done; and
promising, if he would carry them off, to conduct him to another place,
where Strangers were well receiv&rsquo;d, and there was Trade.
<i>Serrano</i> granted their Request, and admitted them, and having
repair&rsquo;d the shatter&rsquo;d <i>Junck</i>, and Embarking
together, they directed their Course to the Island of <i>Amboyna</i>,
where they were well receiv&rsquo;d by the People of <i>Rucutelo</i>,
who were ancient Enemies to those of <i>Veranula</i>, a Neighboring
City of <i>Batochina</i>, with whom those of <i>Rucutelo</i> coming to
a Battle, they obtain&rsquo;d <span class="marginnote"><i>Arrives
at</i> Amboyna.</span> the Victory, through the Assistance of the
New-comers. The Fame of this Success flew over to the <i>Molucco</i>
Islands, at the Time when <i>Boleyse</i> Reign&rsquo;d in
<i>Ternate</i>, and <i>Almanzor</i> in <i>Tydore</i>, who were both not
long before Idolaters, and then <i>Mahometans</i>. These two were at
Variance about the Limits of their Dominions, and understanding that
the <i>Portugueses</i> were at <i>Amboyna</i>, each of them desiring to
Strengthen himself against his Enemy, sent Embassadors, and Ships, to
invite, and bring over to them those Forreign Soldiers; thinking it
also convenient upon other accounts, to enter into Alliance with those
People, whose great Actions were then so fresh in the Mouths of all
Men. <i>Boleyse</i> was quicker than <i>Almanzor</i>, and sent ten
Ships for <i>Serrano</i>, with a Thousand well Arm&rsquo;d Soldiers for
their Defence, the whole under the Command of his Kinsman <i>Cachil
Coliba</i>. The <i>Tydore</i> Embassadors return&rsquo;d from
<i>Rucutelo</i> disappointed. It is but a short Cut between
<i>Amboyna</i>, and <i>Ternate</i>, and therefore
<i>Boylese&rsquo;s</i> Ships soon return&rsquo;d with the
<i>Portugueses</i>. That King went out attended by his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name="pb6">6</a>]</span>Subjects, to
receive the new Guests; all of them concluding, That they went to see
the fulfilling of their so long expected Prophecy. <i>Serrano</i>
Landed in bright white Armour, and his Companions in the same manner.
<span class="marginnote"><i>Settles at</i> Ternate.</span> When the
King saw them, he embrac&rsquo;d every Man, with a Countenance full of
Pleasure and Admiration, shedding Tears, and lifting up his Hands to
Heaven, bless&rsquo;d God, and gave hearty Thanks, for that he had
granted him to see that which had been Predicted so many Years before.
<i>These</i>, said he, <i>my Friends, are the Warriers you have so long
wish&rsquo;d for, on account of my Prophecy. Honour them, and let us
all vie in Entertaining them; since the Grandeur of our Country depends
on their Arms.</i> The <i>Portugueses</i>, well pleas&rsquo;d to be
thought worthy of a Prophecy, the Beleif whereof was a Politick
Invention, conducing to their Reputation, made no less Courteous
Returns, expressing their singular Affection. They settle Amity, and
Trade in the <i>Moluccos</i>; whence they spread it to the adjacent,
and remoter Islands, which it will be now requisite breifly to
Describe, for the better Understanding of this History.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Archipelago <i>describ&rsquo;d</i>.</span>
The Eastern <i>Archipelago</i>, not to speak of the Division of those
Oriental Parts into Northern, and Southern, Contains so many Islands,
that the certain Number of them is not yet known. Hence Modern Authors
distribute it into five Divisions, being so many <i>Archipelagos</i>,
under the names of <i>Molucco</i>, <i>Moro</i>, <i>Papuas</i>,
<i>Celebes</i>, and <i>Amboyna</i>. The Name of the First, in their
Language, is <i>Moloc</i>, signifying, the Head, because it is the
Chief of all about it. Others will have to be <i>Malucco</i>, which, in
<i>Arabick</i>, imports, the Kingdom, as the Principal of them. It
Contains five most Remarkable Islands, all of them under the same
Meridian, one in sight of another, their whole Extent being 25 Leagues;
the Equinoctial crossing them, so that the most Northern of them has
but half a Degree of Latitude that way, and the most Southern, one
Degree on the other side. Near to them, on the East, is the Island
<i>Gilolo</i>, by the <i>Portugueses</i> call&rsquo;d <i>Batochina de
Moro</i>, and by the <i>Moluccos</i>, <i>Alemaera</i>. Among all the
others lying about them, call&rsquo;d also <i>Moluccos</i>, as we say
the <i>Canaries</i>, the <i>Terceras</i>, or the <i>Oreades</i>, these
are the most Remarkable, for their great Plenty of Spice. The Names of
them, beginning with the Northermost, are, <i>Ternate</i>,
<i>Tydore</i>, <i>Motiel</i>, <i>Machian</i>, and <i>Bachian</i>; by
the ancient Heathens call&rsquo;d, <i>Cape</i>, <i>Duco</i>,
<i>Moutil</i>, <i>Mara</i>, and <i>Seque</i>. This last, which is
<i>Bachian</i>, is divided into many Islands, seperated from one
another by little Channels, Navigable only in small Vessels; for which
reason, as also because it is under one Soveraign, it has but one Name,
and all the <i>Molucco</i> Islands are Subject to three Kings. They are
divided by small Arms of the Sea, and some Desert little Islands, as
also by their Antient Enmity. The Coast both near the Shore, and
farther off at Sea, full of Dangerous Shoals; among which there are
some Inlets, where the Ships Ride in Safety. The Soil of them all is
generally Dry and Spungy, sucking up all the Water, tho&rsquo; it Rains
never so much, and in many Places the Brooks that run down from the
Mountains do not reach the Sea. According to that grave Historian
<i>John de Barros</i>, these Islands afford an ill Prospect, and are no
way pleasant to behold; because the Sun being always so near them,
sometimes passing over towards the Northern, and some times towards the
Southern Solstice, the natural Damp of the Earth fills them so full of
Trees, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name=
"pb7">7</a>]</span>Plants, that it thickens the Air, and hinders the
Sight; for by reason of the Earthly Vapours, the Trees are never naked
of Leaves; but before one falls another has sprung out; and the same is
among Herbs. Others affirm, they are Pleasant to look to, but not
Healthy, especially for Strangers, who are all subject to the Disease
call&rsquo;d <i>Berber</i>, which is common in that Country. This
Malady swells the Body, and disables the Limbs, but is cur&rsquo;d with
Cloves, the Wine of the <i>Philippine</i> Islands, drank with Ginger,
and the use of a certain Herb, known to the Natives; and the
<i>Dutch</i> do it with the juyce of Lemmons, a Remedy found by their
own Apprehension, and Experience.</p>
<p>Providence has stor&rsquo;d these Spice-Islands with <i>Bananas</i>,
<i>Coco-Nuts</i>, <span class="marginnote"><i>Product of the</i>
Moluccos.</span> <i>Oranges</i>, <i>Lemmons</i>, <i>Lignum-Aloes</i>,
<i>Sanders</i>, <i>Cinamon</i>, <i>Mace</i>, <i>Mastick-Trees</i>, but
above all, with abundance of <i>Cloves</i>, and other Plants; all of
them valuable for their Fruit, or delightful for their Ornaments. They
have neither <i>Wheat</i> nor <i>Rice</i>; but Nature gave them
Industry, and Matter to supply this Defect. They beat a sort of Tree,
like the <i>Wild-Palm</i>, with Mallets made of strong Canes; and those
dry Trunks, so batter&rsquo;d, yield an extraordinary white Flower,
coming from the bruized Pith; which they mould up in square
<i>Pipkins</i>, and this is the <i>Sagu</i>, or <i>Landan</i>, so made
into square Loaves, <span class="marginnote">Sagu.</span> like the
<i>Castile Sope</i>. This Plant is about Fifteen Foot high, and from
the Top of it sprout out some Branches, like those which produce the
<i>Tamarinds</i>. These bear a Fruit like the <i>Cypress-Nuts</i>, in
which there are certain fine Hairs, which if they touch a Man&rsquo;s
Flesh, burn it. From the tender Branches of the same Plant cut, flows
the Liquor which serves them for Drink, putting the Ends of the said
Branches so cut into narrow Mouth&rsquo;d Vessels, which are
fill&rsquo;d in a Night, and the Liquor so gather&rsquo;d, is like Milk
Whipped, and Frothy, which they call <i>Tuac</i>. When Drank new, it is
Sweet and very Fat&rsquo;ning; boil&rsquo;d like new Wine it tastes
like Wine, and after grows sharp as Vinegar. The same Advantage they
reap from two other Plants call&rsquo;d <i>Nipo</i>, and <i>Coco</i>;
the last of them yields also <i>Oyl</i>, <i>Boards</i>, and
<i>Timber</i> to build Houses. They also Drink another pleasant Liquor,
which Nature has shut up in the Hollow of the Canes they call
<i>Bambooes</i>, so large that the Knots are a Yard a sunder. They
abound in Flesh; but the People are more affected to Fish;
notwithstanding <i>Hugo</i>, the <i>Dutchman</i>, says they want both.
Providence afforded them no Mines, either of <i>Gold</i>, or
<i>Silver</i>; whether it was a Punishment, or Mercy we do not decide.
Neither have they found any, of other less precious Metals; but not far
from them is <i>Lambuco</i>, an Island abounding in Iron and Steel;
whence, and from the Mines of <i>Sula</i> and <i>Butva</i>, the people
of the <i>Maluccos</i> bring them, to make their <i>Caampilanes</i>,
which are sharp heavy <i>Cymiters</i>, and their <i>Crises</i>, being
small <i>Daggers</i>. The <i>Portugueses</i> and <i>Dutch</i> have now
furnish&rsquo;d those Islands with small Fire-Arms, and Cannon of all
sorts known among us.</p>
<p><i>Ternate</i> is the Capital City, and Court of that King, near to
which a <span class="marginnote"><i>A burning Mountain in</i>
Ternate.</span> dreadful burning Mountain Flames out, about the
Equinoxes, because at those Times the Winds blow; which kindle that
natural Fire, on the Matter that has fed it so many Ages. The Top of
the Mountain, which exhales it, is cold, and not cover&rsquo;d with
Ashes, but with asort of light cloddy Earth, little different from the
<i>Pomice-Stone</i> burnt in our Fiery Mountains. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name="pb8">8</a>]</span>Descending
thence to the Foot of the Hill, which stretches out like a Piramid,
down to the Plain; it is all uncooth, being thick with Trees, whose
Verdure is spar&rsquo;d by the Flames, and the very Fire, Waters and
Moistens them with Brooks, which it draws together in the Hollow of the
Mountain, and forces it to Sweat, and pour out.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>People of</i> Ternate.</span> The
Natives Differ from one another, as it were through a Miraculous Bounty
of Nature; for it has made the Women Fair and Beautiful, and the Men,
of a darker Colour than a Quince; their Hair lank, and many anoint it
with sweet Oyls. Their Eyes are large, the Eyebrows long, which, and
their Eye-lashes, they colour Black. Of Body they are Strong, much
addicted to War, and sloathful for all other Employments. They are long
Liv&rsquo;d; grow grey earlie; and are as Active by Sea as by Land;
Officious, and Courteous to Strangers; but when they grow Familiar,
Importunate, and Troublesome in their Requests; in their Dealings, all
bent upon Interest; Jealous, Fraudulent, and False. They are Poor, and
therefore Proud; and to name many Vices in one, Ungrateful.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Religion</i>, <i>Manners</i>,
<i>Laws</i>.</span> The <i>Chineses</i> possess&rsquo;d themselves of
these Islands, when they subdu&rsquo;d all those Eastern Parts; and
after them the <i>Javeneses</i>, and the <i>Malayes</i>, and lastly the
<i>Persians</i>, and <i>Arabs</i>; which last, together with their
Trade, Introduc&rsquo;d the <i>Mahometan</i> Superstition among the
Worship of their Gods; from whom some Families boasted they were
descended. Their Laws are Barbarous: They have no limited Number of
Wives. The King&rsquo;s chief Wife, call&rsquo;d in their Language
<i>Putriz</i>, enables and gives the Right of Succession to which her
Sons are preferr&rsquo;d, tho&rsquo; younger than those by other
Mothers. <i>Theft</i> is not pardon&rsquo;d, tho&rsquo; never so
inconsiderable; but <i>Adultery</i> easily. When the Dawn appears,
Officers appointed by Law for that purpose, beat a sort of broad, flat
Tabors about the Streets, to awake Marry&rsquo;d People, who they think
deserves this Care from the Government, on account of Procreation. Most
Crimes are punish&rsquo;d with Death; in other Respects they Obey the
Will, or Tyranny of the Conqueror.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Their Habit.</i></span> The Men, on
their Heads, wear <i>Turkish</i> Turbants of several Colours, with
abundance of Feathers on them. The King&rsquo;s ends above like a
Miter, and serves instead of a Crown. For their other Garb they all
wear Wastecoats, which they call <i>Cheninas</i>, and Blew, Crimson,
Green, and Purple Breeches. Of the same they make their Cloaks, or
Mantles, which are short, Soldier-like, thrown over, or knotted on the
Shoulder, after the Ancient <i>Roman</i> manner, known by the written
Descriptions, Statues, and other Monuments of those Times. The Women
are Proud of their Hair; sometimes they spread, and sometimes they plat
it, sticking abundance of Flowers among the Ribbons, which hold it
together; so that in their Dress, they are not encumber&rsquo;d with
loose Viels, Plumes, or Feathers. All that variety adorns them without
Art; they wear <i>Bracelets</i>, <i>Pendants</i>, and <i>Necklaces</i>
of <i>Diamonds</i> and <i>Rubies</i>, and great Strings of
<i>Pearls</i>, which are not forbid even the meanest, no more than
Silks, wherein the Women particularly are Clad after the <i>Persian</i>
and <i>Turkish</i> Fashion; and all this costly Attire is the Product
of the Neighbouring Lands and Seas. Both Men and Women in their Habit
show their natural Haughtiness.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Language.</i></span> The variety of
Languages among them is great, for sometimes one Town does not
understand the People of the next; the <i>Malaye</i> Tongue is most
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name=
"pb9">9</a>]</span>us&rsquo;d, as easiest to pronounce. This Diversity
of Languages shows, that those Islands were Peopled by several Nations.
In those Parts all Antiquity, and the Art of Navigation are
ascrib&rsquo;d to the <i>Chineses</i>. Some affirm, That the People of
the <i>Molucco</i> Islands are Descended from the <i>Jaos</i>, who
settled there being invited by the Fragrancy of the Spice. They loaded
their Vessels with Cloves, till then unknown, and holding on that
Trade, carry&rsquo;d it to the Gulphs of <i>Arabia</i>, and
<i>Persia</i>. They Sail&rsquo;d about all those Countries,
transporting Silks, and Porcelance, the Product, and Manufacture of
<i>China</i>. The Cloves were by the <i>Persians</i>, and <i>Arabs</i>
transmitted to the <i>Greeks</i>, and <i>Romans</i>. Some <i>Roman</i>
Emperors had a design of Conquering the East, till they should come to
the Spicy Countries; so covetous were they of that Commodity; and
believing they all came from <i>China</i>, call&rsquo;d all those
People <i>Chineses</i>. The <i>Spaniards</i> formerly brought them
among other Goods from the <i>Red-Sea</i>. The Kings of <i>Egypt</i>
for some time possess&rsquo;d themselves of all the Spice which they
Transmitted from the <span class="marginnote"><i>How Cloves were
brought into</i> Europe.</span> Hands of the <i>Asiaticks</i> into
<i>Europe</i>. This the <i>Romans</i> continu&rsquo;d, when they
reduc&rsquo;d <i>Egypt</i> into the Form of a Province. Long after, the
<i>Genoeses</i>, Transferring the Trade to <i>Theodosia</i>, now
<i>Caffa</i>, handed them about to all Parts; and there the
<i>Venetians</i>, and other Trading Nations, had their Consuls, and
Factors. They afterwards were convey&rsquo;d over the <i>Caspian</i>
Sea and <i>Trabisond</i>; but this Trade fell with the Eastern Empire;
and then the <i>Turks</i> carry&rsquo;d them in Caravans of Camels, and
Dromedaries to <i>Berytus</i>, <i>Aleppo</i>, <i>Damascus</i>, and
several Ports on the <i>Mediterranean</i>. The Sultans of <i>Egypt</i>
brought them back to the <i>Red-Sea</i>, and thence to
<i>Alexandria</i>, down the <i>Nile</i>. The <i>Portugueses</i> having
Conquer&rsquo;d the <i>East-Indies</i>, took them from <i>Egypt</i>,
and brought them in their Fleets by the Cape of <i>Good Hope</i>,
sinking and taking all Ships that attempted to carry any to <i>Grand
Cayro</i>. For that purpose they kept Squadrons on the Coasts of
<i>Arabia</i> and <i>Persia</i>, and at Cape <i>Guardafu</i>. By this
means the Trade of <i>Egypt</i> was surpress&rsquo;d, and all the Spice
brought on the Kings account to <i>India</i>, and thence taking a
prodigious compass, to <i>Lisbon</i>. He who is Master at Sea will be
possess&rsquo;d of this Wealth; by which, and other Commodities, we see
that is made good, which some write <i>Themistocles</i> was wont to
say, <i>That he has all things who has the Sea</i>.</p>
<p>The Kings, <i>Boleyfe</i>, of <i>Ternate</i>, and <i>Almanzor</i>,
of <i>Tydore</i>, contended about Entertaining <i>Serrano</i>, and each
of them courted him to build a Fort in his Island. It is well worth
Observation, To see how eagerly these Kings sought after, and
begg&rsquo;d for that which they were soon after to be averse to. They
writ about it to the King of <i>Portugal</i>; but <i>Antony de
Miranda</i> coming to the <i>Moluccos</i>, besides a wooden Fort, or
House he built at <i>Talangame</i>, erected another at <i>Machian</i>,
an Island belonging to the two Kings, by which means he satisfy&rsquo;d
the Request of both. Soon after <i>Cachil Laudin</i>, King of
<i>Bachian</i>, made Application to <i>Don Tristan de Meneses</i>, on
the same account. <i>Don Tristan</i> was come to the <i>Moluccos</i> to
Load Spice, and with a design to carry away <i>Francis Serrano</i>, and
to induce <i>Boleyfe</i> to consent to it, he perswaded him, it was
requisite that <i>Serrano</i> should go to <i>Portugal</i>, to prevail
upon King <i>Emanuel</i> to order the Fort he desir&rsquo;d, to be
built upon <i>Ternate</i>, and not elsewhere. <i>Boleyfe</i>
approv&rsquo;d of his design, and to that end, sent <i>Cachilato</i>,
as his Embassador, with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href=
"#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span><i>Serrano</i>. <i>Don Tristan</i>
set out, and his Ships being dispers&rsquo;d in a Storm, was
oblig&rsquo;d to return to the <i>Moluccos</i>, and to Winter in the
Wooden House above mention&rsquo;d; but as soon as the <i>Monson</i>
blew, he put to Sea again, and touching at <i>Bachian</i> was
inform&rsquo;d, That they had kill&rsquo;d some <i>Portugueses</i>, of
<i>Simon Correa</i>&rsquo;s Vessel in that Island. This troubled him,
but he dissembled it, and proceeding on his Voyage, return&rsquo;d to
<i>Malaca</i>, by the way of <i>Amboyna</i>.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Brito <i>at the</i> Molucco&rsquo;s.</span>
<i>Antony de Brito</i>, appointed by the Governour of <i>India</i> to
succeed <i>Serrano</i> in that Post, Sail&rsquo;d from Cape
<i>Sincapura</i>, through the Streights of <i>Sabam</i>, with 300 Men,
and some experienc&rsquo;d Commanders. He touch&rsquo;d at
<i>Tuban</i>, a City in the Island of <i>Jaua</i>, and went over to
another, call&rsquo;d <i>Agazim</i>, a Mart in those Parts, opposite to
the Island <i>Madura</i>. Its nearness inviting him, he sent a Roving
Vessel thither to get some Information what Course he was to Steer.
Seventeen Men there were in the Vessel Landed on the Coast, and went up
along the side of a River, cover&rsquo;d with beautiful Trees, whose
Fruit deceiv&rsquo;d the Sailers; for they attracted with the pleasant
sight, and unexpected satisfaction, forgot to secure their Vessel. The
Natives observing the Opportunity, first took the Vessel, and then all
the Men, whose Ransom prov&rsquo;d afterwards difficult, tho&rsquo; the
Lord of the City favour&rsquo;d it. <i>Brito</i> sail&rsquo;d directly
for the <i>Moluccos</i>, and touching at <i>Bachian</i>, sent <i>Simon
de Abreu</i> in all haste to burn a Village, and kill all the
Inhabitants, in Revenge for <i>Simon Correa</i>&rsquo;s Companions
slain there; that King <i>Laudin</i> might understand, they should not
escape unpunish&rsquo;d, who wrong&rsquo;d the <i>Portuguese</i>, and
that since his Island was the first that took up Arms <span class=
"marginnote"><i>King of</i> Ternate <i>Dies</i>.</span> against them,
it should also be the first that felt their Vengeance. He executed his
severity without any Loss, tho&rsquo; that King did not forget the
Obligation he laid on him. <i>Brito</i> went on to <i>Tydore</i>, and
was Inform&rsquo;d by <i>Almanzor</i> of the Disorders there were at
<i>Ternate</i>, because <i>Boleyfe</i> was dead, and it was
suppos&rsquo;d he had been Poyson&rsquo;d. He being near his Death
order&rsquo;d, That during the Minority of his eldest Son <i>Cachil
Bohat</i>, or <i>Boyano</i>, the Queen his Wife, who was Daughter to
the King of <i>Tydore</i>, should Govern; and that <i>Cachil
Daroes</i>, Natural Son to the said <i>Boleyfe</i>, should Act jointly
with her. The Queen who was Crafty, suspecting that her Father
<i>Almanzor</i> might under that colour aim st some Advantage, to the
Detriment of her Son, call&rsquo;d her Subjects together and told them,
That it was enough for her to take care of her Sons Education; and
therefore she laid the greatest stress of Government on <i>Cachil
Daroes</i>.</p>
<p>The King, and the Governour <i>Daroes</i>, expected the Commander
<i>Antony Brito</i>, as the Kingdoms, and the young Kings Protector.
They went out to <span class="marginnote"><i>A Fort Built at</i>
Ternate.</span> meet him in a Fleet of <i>Carcoas</i>, with the Noise
of that Barbarous Musick of Brass Basons, and Tabors. He Landed,
shewing State, and appearing worthy of that Applause; visited the
Queen, the King, and his Brothers; and after the Ceremony of Condoling
the Death of <i>Boleyfe</i>, ordering Affairs in Conjunction with
<i>Daroes</i>, he approv&rsquo;d of that Form of Government, and upon
all occasions Defended his Province against that of <i>Tydore</i>. To
do this with the greatest Security, he pitch&rsquo;d upon a proper spot
of Ground, according to the Rules of Fortification, which were not then
very perfect, no more than Military Discipline. The Foundation being
dug, <i>Brito</i>, in the presence of the King, and all the People,
laid the first Stone of the new Fort, with his own Hand. This
happen&rsquo;d on Midsummer Day, and therefore <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name="pb11">11</a>]</span>he gave
the Fort the Name of <i>St. John Baptist</i>; and tho&rsquo; it was
built for the Defence of <i>Ternate</i>, yet in <i>Brito</i>&rsquo;s
mind it was Dedicated to the service of the Gospel, and its Ministers.
He us&rsquo;d endeavours to send away the <i>Caeiz</i> he found there
spreading of <i>Mahomet</i>&rsquo;s false Doctrine, as an Obstacle to
the True; but the War which is there always settled and natural against
<i>Tydore</i>, obstructed these Designs; tho&rsquo; at the same time
the Troubles of those two Revengeful Nations increas&rsquo;d the
Revenues of <i>Portugal</i>, by contributing of their Spice: and the
desire of Superiority brought them into Subjection. However, in
<i>Portugal</i> <i>Brito</i> had a Successor appointed him, and he was
inform&rsquo;d, That the other was already sailing for the
<i>Moluccos</i>; and there was need enough of them both, and of
doubling their Forces; because <i>Spain</i> still insisted upon taking
those Countries as its Right, and <i>Brito</i> began to be hated, on
account of his offering Violence to the Royal Family.</p>
<p>At the same time <i>Magellan</i> having Sail&rsquo;d 600 Leagues
towards <i>Malaca</i>, <span class="marginnote">Magellan <i>goes over
to</i> Spain.</span> was in certain Islands, whence he corresponded
with <i>Serrano</i>; who having thriv&rsquo;d so well in
<i>Ternate</i>, with <i>Boleyfe</i>, sent his Friend word what
Kindness, and Wealth he had receiv&rsquo;d from him; advising him to
return to his Company. <i>Magellan</i> consenting, resolv&rsquo;d to go
to the <i>Moluccos</i>; but in case his Services were not Rewarded in
<i>Portugal</i>, as he expected, he would take the way directly for
<i>Ternate</i>, under whose King <i>Serrano</i> grew so Rich in Nine
Years. He consider&rsquo;d, that since the <i>Moluccos</i> were 600
Leagues East from <i>Malaca</i>, which make 30 Degrees, little more or
less, they were out of the <i>Portuguese</i> Limits, according to the
antient Sea Chart. Returning to <i>Portugal</i>, he found no Favour,
but thought himself wrong&rsquo;d, and resenting it, went away into
<i>Castile</i>, carrying with him a Planisphere, drawn by <i>Peter
Reynel</i>; by which, and the Correspondence he had held with
<i>Serrano</i>, he perswaded the Emperor, <i>Charles</i> V. that the
<i>Molucco</i> Islands belong&rsquo;d to him. It is reported, That he
Confirm&rsquo;d his Opinion with Writings, and the Authority of <i>Ruy
Faleyro</i>, a <i>Portuguese</i> Judiciary Astrologer, and much more
with <i>Serrano</i>&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Hereupon the Emperor gave him the Command of a Squadron, with which
he sail&rsquo;d from <i>Sanlucar</i>, on the <i>21st</i>. of
<i>September, 1519</i>. He stay&rsquo;d <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Sets out on his Discovery.</i></span> four days at the
<i>Canaries</i>, where a Caravel overtook him, with private
Intelligence, that his Captains went with a Design not to Obey him
particularly <i>John Cartagena</i>, who had the same Commission as
<i>Magellan</i>. He bravely seem&rsquo;d to take no notice, and sailing
away with a fair Wind, being pass&rsquo;d <i>Rio de Janeyro</i>, in the
Province of <i>Santa Cruz</i>, commonly call&rsquo;d <i>Brazil</i>, the
Sea growing very cold, and much more the <i>River of Plate</i>, which
is in 35 Degrees of South Latitude, the Captains question&rsquo;d him
about the Voyage, since they could nor find the Cape, or Streight, they
went in search of. He answer&rsquo;d, as to Men that were entirely
Subordinate to his Direction and Authority, <i>That they must go on,
for he knew what he was about, and the Coasts of</i> Norway <i>and</i>
Ireland <i>were in a greater Latitude, and yet Ships sailed along
them</i>. These Contests lasted almost all the Voyage, and
increas&rsquo;d with the cold and dreadful Winds, and the hideous sight
of the Mountains of Snow and Ice, grown old, which they met in the
Latitude of 52 and 53 Degrees. They magnify&rsquo;d these Difficulties,
alledging, That it requir&rsquo;d six, or seven Months to come from
<i>Castile</i>, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name=
"pb12">12</a>]</span>cross the Line, and run all along the Coast of
<i>Brazil</i>, through such diversity of Climates, in each of which the
Weather vary&rsquo;d. That this was throwing away Men and Ships, which
were more valuable than all the Cloves in the <i>Molucco</i>
Islands.</p>
<p>The Astrologer, <i>Ruy Faleyro</i>, being Distracted, was left in
the Mad-House <span class="marginnote"><i>He discovers the Streight of
his Name.</i></span> at <i>Sevil</i>; and in his Place went <i>Andrew
de San Martin</i>, to whom <i>Magellan</i> gave Ear, as to what he said
of the Weather; but not in other Cases, as some lay to his Charge, and
with such Moderation and Integrity, as becomes Christian Piety. Nor is
it to be believ&rsquo;d, That <i>Magellan</i> should consult such a
Deceitful a Science as Judiciary Astrology, upon such difficult Points,
or should prefer it before Astronomy, amidst such dreadful Dangers. The
Hardships became intollerable; and Discord so far prevail&rsquo;d with
the Captains, <i>John de Cartagena</i>, <i>Gaspar Quesada</i>, and
<i>Lewis de Mendoza</i>, that they resolved either to Kill, or Secure
<i>Magellan</i>. This Conspiracy coming to his Ears, as he lay at the
Mouth of the River of St. <i>Julian</i>, having contriv&rsquo;d what
was to be done, as <i>John de Barros</i> writes, he caus&rsquo;d
<i>Lewis de Mendoza</i> to be Stab&rsquo;d, which was done by
<i>Gonzalo de Espinosa</i>. Next <i>Gaspar de Quesada</i> was
Quarter&rsquo;d Alive; and a Servant of his, who was concern&rsquo;d,
had his Pardon. <i>Cartagena</i> he condemned to a lingering Death,
leaving him in that Desert Country, with a Clergy Man, guilty of the
same Crime, which was High Treason against their King. So say the
<i>Portuguese</i> Histories; but the <i>Spanish</i> inform us, That
they were privately proceeded against, and the Judgment was Read to
them. This done he made some Speeches to Justify the Fact, and Comfort
his Companions. <i>Cartagena</i>, and the Clergy-Man, who were left
with some Provisions, got away a few days after, in one of the Ships of
the same Squadron, which return&rsquo;d to <i>Spain</i>.
<i>Magellan</i> overcoming incredible Difficulties, found the Streight,
and Passage, which makes the Communication between the two Seas, and
preserves his Name to this Day. He there took Giants above fifteen
Spans high, who wanting raw Flesh, which they us&rsquo;d to feed on,
soon Dy&rsquo;d; then he passed the Streight successfully. But
tho&rsquo; he got under the Equinoctial, either by reason of the
Currents, or the Faultiness of the Sea Charts, he Sail&rsquo;d round
about, and almost in sight of the <i>Molucco</i> Islands, yet could
never come at them. He Touch&rsquo;d at others, where he was
oblig&rsquo;d to Fight; and went on to those of <i>Zebu</i>, or the
<i>Manilas</i>. At this same time his Friend <i>Serrano</i> was sailing
for <i>India</i>, and tho&rsquo; it happen&rsquo;d in several Places,
yet they both Dy&rsquo;d on the same Day, and much after the same
Manner.</p>
<p>It would be superfluous to dilate upon the Story of <i>Magellan</i>,
his tedious Navigation, and the many Difficulties he met with, before
and after he pass&rsquo;d through his Streight into the
<i>Pacifick</i>, or <i>South-Sea</i>; his Arrival at the Island of
<i>Zebu</i>, and perswading the Idolatrous King to embrace the
Christian Faith, and the Battles he fought on his account, with his
Enemies; for besides that these things are Related by very good Authors
who Treat of the Discovery of the <i>Molucco</i> Islands, which was the
main Object of his desperate Undertaking, we must be brief in repeating
them, to show how eager several Princes, and Nations were for these
Islands, and the Notion they had of what great Consequence they would
be to them.</p>
<p>The King of <i>Zebu</i> was Baptiz&rsquo;d, rather to make his
Advantage of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13</a>]</span><i>Spanish</i> Arms, than out of any Zeal, or that
he knew the Faith he Embrac&rsquo;d. He took the Name of
<i>Ferdinand</i> in Baptism, to flatter his Godfather, who <span class=
"marginnote"><i>He is Murder&rsquo;d with others.</i></span> was
<i>Ferdinand Magalhaens</i>, himself. After obtaining several Victories
by his Assistance, thinking he could shake off the second Yoke he
expected those Strangers might lay on him, he turn&rsquo;d against
them. He contriv&rsquo;d an Entertainment, in Honour of <i>Magellan</i>
and Thirty five <i>Spaniards</i> being at it, he fell upon them at a
time appointed, with a Multitude of Barbarians, and confounding the
Feast, murder&rsquo;d his Guests, who handled their Arms to defend
themselves, which only serv&rsquo;d to render their Deaths more
Honourable. The rest of the <i>Spaniards</i>, who escap&rsquo;d because
they were at Sea, for their better Government under that Misfortune,
presently chose <i>Barbosa</i>, a Kinsman of <i>Magalhaens</i>, for
their General, and <i>Lewis Alfonso</i>, a <i>Portuguese</i> to be
Captain of the Ship, call&rsquo;d the Victory. The perfidious King,
thinking to conceal his Treachery and Apostacy, as if it were possible
to keep it secret, sent to invite <i>Barbosa</i>, saying he would
deliver him the Jewel he had promis&rsquo;d for the King of
<i>Spain</i>. <i>John Serrano</i>, thinking it a Rashness, to trust a
Man again, whose Hands were still Bloody with the late Execution,
disswaded <i>Barbosa</i> from accepting of the Invitation; but was not
regarded. <i>Barbosa</i> went with the other Guests, and <i>Serrano</i>
himself, who, to show it was not Fear that mov&rsquo;d him to give such
Advice, was the first that got into the Boat. They were conducted into
a Wood of <i>Palm-Trees</i>, where the King expected them, with a small
Retinue, the Tables being spread in the Shade, amidst the Musick of
Bag-Pipes. When they were seated, and began to Eat, a great number of
Archers that lay in Ambush, rush&rsquo;d out, and shot our Men. They
saved <i>Serrano</i>, whom they lov&rsquo;d, not out of Kindness, for
they show&rsquo;d him bound to those that were at Sea, demanding for
his Ransom, two Brass Guns, and then he told them, the Slaughter that
had been made. Our Men, not trusting to them, any longer, set Sail, and
did not only see the <i>Indians</i> carry <i>Serrano</i> back to their
Town, but soon after heard mighty Shouts in it; and it was afterwards
known that they gave them when they killed <i>Serrano</i>, and ran to
throw down a great Cross, set up before the New-Church, which they
could not perform. The <i>Spaniards</i> wanting Men, burnt the Ships,
call&rsquo;d the <i>Conception</i>, and chose <i>John Caravallo</i> for
their General, and <i>Gonzalo Gomez de Espinosa</i>, Captain of the
Ship the <i>Victory</i>. They came to <i>Borneo</i>, on the Coast
whereof they found those Peoples Fleet of <i>Carcoas</i>, Painted, and
the Prows of them like Serpents Heads gilt.</p>
<p>The Soldiers appear&rsquo;d well Arm&rsquo;d, who having spy&rsquo;d
our Ship, acquainted <span class="marginnote"><i>Soldiers of</i>
Borneo, <i>and Reception of</i> Spaniards.</span> their King with it.
He order&rsquo;d 2000 of his Guard to go out, and receive them, before
they reach&rsquo;d the City. These Men came brandishing their Bows and
poison&rsquo;d Arrows, Trunks, Cymitars, and Sheilds, and wore
Breast-plates made of <i>Tortois</i> Shells, and encompass&rsquo;d an
Arm&rsquo;d <i>Elephant</i>, on whose Back there was a wooden Castle.
When the <i>Spaniards</i> came up the Elephant stoop&rsquo;d down, and
six arm&rsquo;d Men coming out of the Castle, put <i>Gonzalo Gomez de
Espinosa</i>, who was then General, into it. Thus attended, he went to
Visit the King, in whose Presence his Secretary spoke to him through a
Trunk, and <i>Espinosa</i> gave him an Account of the King of
<i>Zebu</i>&rsquo;s Perfidiousness. All condol&rsquo;d the Accident,
and our Men taking Leave Sail&rsquo;d away for the <i>Molucco</i>
Islands, being reliev&rsquo;d with what they wanted, and
furnish&rsquo;d with able Pilots. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14"
href="#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span></p>
<p>Not far from <i>Borneo</i>, they met 150 Sail, whereof they took two
<i>Junks</i>, <span class="marginnote">Spaniards <i>at</i>
Tydore.</span> in which they found an Hundred Men, five Women, a Son of
the King of <i>Luzon</i>, and an Infant two Months Old. This they
thought would be a sufficient Ransom to recover their Companions; so
they let go the Prince upon his Parole, he promising to restore them
the Captive <i>Spaniards</i>. They had some Storms; but arriv&rsquo;d
at <i>Tydore</i>, on the 8th of <i>November 1521</i><span class="corr"
id="xd21e2225" title="Source: ,">.</span> When <i>Almanzor</i> heard
the salute of the Canon, he sent to enquire what People they were, and
presently after he came to our Ships in a little Boat. His Shirt
appear&rsquo;d woven with Gold and Silk, a white Cloth which
trail&rsquo;d being girt over it. About his Head a fine Veil of several
Colours, made like a <i>Persian</i> Miter: Being Aboard the Commodore,
the Relations of that Voyage say, he stopp&rsquo;d his Nose with his
Fingers, either at the Smell of our Meat, or of the Ship.
<i>Mahometanism</i> was newly come into his Island, and most of his
Subjects, especially those Inhabiting the Mountains, ador&rsquo;d
Idols. He bid our Men wellcome, gave them good Words, and <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e2238" title="Source: afterwads">afterwards</span> was
as kind in his Actions; and being inform&rsquo;d of their past
Sufferings, gave them leave to load Cloves. They presented him with a
Chair of Crimson Velvet, a Robe of Yellow Velvet, a great Loose Coat of
false Cloth of Gold, a piece of Yellow Damask, four Yards of Scarlet
Cloth; Handkercheifs, and Towles, wrought with Silk, and Gold;
Drinking-Glasses, Glass Beads, Looking-Glasses, Knives, Scizers, and
Combs. They gave his Son another parcel of Gifts, and a Cap, and did
the like by his <i>Cachiles</i> and <i>Sangiacks</i>. When they
ask&rsquo;d the Kings leave in the Emperors Name to Trade, he granted
it, adding they should kill any that offer&rsquo;d to hinder them. He
seriously view&rsquo;d his Majesty&rsquo;s Picture and Arms on the
Standard, and desired to see our Coin. And pretending to be an
Astrologer, or Soothsayer, or as others say, having Dreamt, or
Guess&rsquo;d it, or being told it by <i>Chinese</i> Priests, he said,
<i>He knew the Christians were to come to his Lands for Spice; and
desired that they would not leave him.</i> <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Ally with that King.</i></span> They treated about an
Alliance, and when they were agreed, two <i>Tydores</i> brought
something in their Hands to the Ships, which they afterwards understood
was the <i>Alcoran</i>, tho&rsquo; at first they did not, because
cover&rsquo;d with Silks, and Strings. <i>Almanzor</i> lay&rsquo;d his
Hands on it, and then on his Head, and Breast; and this was the
Ceremony of his Swearing Friendship, and Fealty to the Crown of
<i>Castile</i>, and that he would allow them Cloves, and all Commerce
for ever. Then the General <i>Espinosa</i>, in the Emperor&rsquo;s
Name, before an Image of the blessed Virgin, swore to protect them both
in Peace and War, and presented King <i>Almanzor</i> with Thirty
<i>Indians</i> he had taken Prisoners. Soon after, as some Authors
affirm, <i>Corala</i>, Prince of <i>Ternate</i>, Nephew to
<i>Almanzor</i>, came to <i>Tydore</i> to swear Fealty in like manner,
as did <i>Luzuf</i>, King of <i>Gilolo</i>, of whom it is Written, That
he had Six Hundred Sons, and that <i>Almanzor</i> had Two Hundred
Wives. These Kings Writ to the Emperor; ratifying their Fealty, and
<i>Sebastian del Cano</i> sail&rsquo;d away in the Ship, the
<i>Victory</i>, by the way the <i>Portugueses</i> use, with the Letters
and Instruments; the General <i>Espinosa</i> returning towards
<i>Panama</i>, for <i>Castilla del Oro</i> on the Continent of
<i>America</i>, to pass thence to <i>Spain</i>.</p>
<p>At this time the new Governor, <i>Don Garcia Henriquez</i>, was
under Sail, to succeed <i>Antony Brito</i>, and being come to
<i>Banda</i>, waited for the <i>Monson</i> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>to carry
him to <i>Ternate</i>. <i>Monson</i> is the Name by which the
<i>Portuguese</i> <span class="marginnote">Monson, <i>what it
is</i>.</span> call the Wind, which blows six Months to carry them to
<i>India</i>, and then six Months again to bring them back. There he
furnished himself with all Necessaries for the Fort built by
<i>Brito</i>. He had need so to do, for he received Advice, That
<i>Spanish</i> Ships were sailing thro&rsquo; the Bays, and openest
Parts of the <i>Archipelago</i>. He sent to discover them, by the
Industry of his Soldiers, and being receiv&rsquo;d at <i>Ternate</i>,
view&rsquo;d the Fort, and observ&rsquo;d the posture of the
Government. He proposed a Peace with <i>Cachil Almanzor</i>, King of
<i>Tydore</i>. We shall have frequent Occasion to repeat these Words
<i>Cachil</i> and <i>Sangiack</i>. <i>Cachil</i> is perhaps
deriv&rsquo;d from <i>Katil</i>, which in <i>Arabick</i> <span class=
"marginnote">Cachil <i>and</i> Sangiack, <i>their
significations</i>.</span> is the same as among us, a Valiant Soldier.
In the <i>Molucco</i> Islands they Honour their Nobility with this
Title, which is something more than <i>Don</i> in <i>Spain</i>. The
Title of <i>Sangiack</i>, which answers to that of Duke, or Earl, might
come from <i>Senchaq</i>; which in the <i>Turkish</i> Language, imports
a Commander: To conclude this Peace, he thought it convenient to secure
the Royal Family; which he accordingly executed, and though he
colour&rsquo;d it with fair Pretexts, they plainly perceived this was
an Introduction towards Oppressing them, and show&rsquo;d a mistrust.
We may safely affirm, This was the first Distaste which, as being a
notorious Wrong, <span class="marginnote">Portugueses, <i>why
hated</i>.</span> disturb&rsquo;d that Nation, and from that time they
grew Cold, and Jealous, thinking themselves oblig&rsquo;d to seek
Revenge; and this Action was the occasion of all the ensuing
Slaughters, as we often see a great Fire rise from one small Spark.</p>
<p><i>Cachil Daroes</i> endeavour&rsquo;d to obstruct this Peace, as
Tutor, and Governor, fearing the Trade of Cloves would be
transferr&rsquo;d to <i>Tydore</i>, to the Destruction of the Infant
King&rsquo;s Dominions. But notwithstanding this Opposition, the Peace
was concluded, upon certain Conditions, as, That the King of
<i>Tydore</i> should deliver a Ship he had taken, the <i>Canon</i>, and
some <span class="marginnote"><i>More of their Outrages.</i></span>
runaway <i>Portuguese</i>. <i>Almanzor</i>, who stood in need of a
Peace, and the Friendship of the <i>Portuguese</i>, to gain the
Affection of <i>Cachil Daroes</i>, propos&rsquo;d to Marry him to one
of his Daughters. <i>Don Garcia</i> believing that this Union among
them would produce that of their Forces, and less Submission to the
<i>Portuguese</i>&rsquo;s Dominion, to obstruct this dangerous
Alliance, sent to the King of <i>Tydore</i> to borrow the Canon. That
King excus&rsquo;d himself, alledging, that he had lent it a few days
before, to the King of <i>Bachian</i>. <i>Cachil Daroes</i> complying
with him, agreed to all the Articles. <i>Don Garcia</i> being
dissatisfy&rsquo;d, waited an opportunity to break all that
Contrivance, and be Reveng&rsquo;d. <i>Almanzor</i> fell Sick, and
desir&rsquo;d <i>Don Garcia</i> to send him a Physician; who sent an
Apothecary, and he either not understanding Physick, or, as was
believ&rsquo;d, by order of <i>Don Garcia</i>, kill&rsquo;d the
Patient. Manifest tokens of Poyson afterwards appear&rsquo;d. The
Funeral was order&rsquo;d, and at the same time the Commander, <i>Don
Garcia</i>, appear&rsquo;d in the Morning, in a parcel of
<i>Carcoas</i>, before <i>Tydore</i>. He sent <i>Baldaya</i>, the Clerk
of the Fort, to demand the Canon, threatning War, in case of denial.
The Regents excusing themselves at that time, with just Reasons, and
particularly the Funeral Solemnity, when they were in the Height of the
Ceremony of Burying their King, they heard the Shouts of <i>Don
Garcia</i>&rsquo;s Men giving the Assault. The <i>Portuguese</i>
enter&rsquo;d the City, firing the Houses, plundering and killing,
which oblig&rsquo;d the <i>Tydores</i> to abandon their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name=
"pb16">16</a>]</span>King&rsquo;s Body, and fly to the Mountains.
During their Absence, <i>Don Garcia</i> seized the Canon, and
carry&rsquo;d it away to <i>Ternate</i>. Those who had fled
return&rsquo;d, with some Apprehension, and found the City ruin&rsquo;d
hideous, and almost reduc&rsquo;d to Ashes; but recovering from their
Fright; they proclaim&rsquo;d <i>Cachil Raxamira</i>, the Son of
<i>Almanzor</i>, King. They committed the Education of him to <i>Cachil
Rade</i>, his Kinsman, the War being declared between <i>Ternate</i>
and the New King of <i>Tydore</i>, who was seasonably supported by the
<i>Spaniards</i> that came to his Country.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Spanish <i>Ship first round the
World</i>.</span> The Ship <i>Victory</i> returning into <i>Spain</i>,
with the Letters from the King of the <i>Molucco</i> Islands, which the
Emperor receiv&rsquo;d, he was more fully convinc&rsquo;d, that these
Islands were within his Limits. Their Wealth, and his Right to them
were so lively represented to him, that he order&rsquo;d another
Squadron of four Ships, two Galloons, and an Advice Boat to be made
ready at <i>Corunna</i>, to be Commanded by the Commendary <i>Fray
Garcia de Loaysa</i>, a Gentleman of <i>Biscay</i>, and under him, as
Vice-Admiral, <i>Sebastian del Cano</i>, and the Captains <i>Don
Rodrigo de Acunna</i>, <i>James de Vera</i>, &amp;c. They Sail&rsquo;d
on the Eve of St. <i>James</i> the Apostle, 1525, touch&rsquo;d at
<i>Gomera</i>, and running along the Coast of <i>Guinea</i>, could not
make Cape St. <i>Augustine</i> for want of Wind. By reason of this
Calm, all agreeing to it, he alter&rsquo;d his Course to the Cape of
<i>Good Hope</i>. A <i>Portuguese</i> Ship guided them to</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Another Squadron passes</i> Magellans
<i>Streights</i>.</span> the Island of St. <i>Matthew</i>, which is
Desert, and full of lofty Orange Trees, where they saw Hens, the Track
of wild Boars, and some <i>Portuguese</i> Words carv&rsquo;d on Trees,
which shew&rsquo;d they had pass&rsquo;d that way. The Ships leaving
them, they pass&rsquo;d Cape St. <i>Augustine</i>, making for the
Streights of <i>Magellan</i>. In this Course they endur&rsquo;d Storms,
and Err&rsquo;d in their Accounts. <i>Sebastian del Cano</i> struck on
a Shoal, and was reliev&rsquo;d. The Galloons and Advice Boat made
<i>New Spain</i>. The Admiral, by the Advice of <i>Cano</i>,
pass&rsquo;d the Equinoctial, upon information, That in 12 Degrees of
South Latitude, he would find certain Islands that were rich in Gold
and Silver. All the Men sickn&rsquo;d, the Admiral, and <i>Cano</i>
dy&rsquo;d, with some others. The remains of the Squadron choosing
<i>Toribio de Salazar</i> for their Commander, return&rsquo;d under the
Line; but he dy&rsquo;d at the Islands <i>de las Velas</i>, now
call&rsquo;d <i>Ladrones</i>, or of <i>Thieves</i>. After some Strife,
<i>Martin Iniguez</i>, and <i>Ferdinand de Bustamante</i> succeeded
him, and agree&rsquo;d to Command by turns. Thus divided they came in
sight of <i>Mindanao</i>, and thence to the <i>Molucco</i> Islands,
took in some Refreshment at <i>Cope</i>, a Town of the Island
<i>Moratay</i>, whence they went on to <i>Camafo</i>, of
<i>Morotoja</i>, whose <i>Sangiack</i> is Subject to the King of
<i>Tydore</i>.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>War betwixt</i> Spaniards <i>and</i>
Portugueses.</span> They proceeded through the Gulph of <i>Camafo</i>,
where they were Inform&rsquo;d by the Ship of <i>Don George de
Meneses</i>, who had been forc&rsquo;d thither by the Currents, that
the <i>Portugueses</i> held the Fort of <i>Ternate</i>, and <i>Don
Garcia</i> made War on <i>Tydore</i>. <i>Iniguez</i>, and
<i>Bustamante</i> offer&rsquo;d them the Assistance of <i>Spain</i>, by
which, coming so opportunely, they gain&rsquo;d the Affections of them
all, and furnished themselves with Necessaries. <i>Don Garcia</i> being
already provided against the new Enemy, gather&rsquo;d some
<i>Carcoas</i>, and tho&rsquo; he could not perswade <i>Daroes</i>, the
Tutor, to go along with him, oppos&rsquo;d the <i>Spaniards</i>. First
the <i>Portuguese</i> sent an Admonition, wherein he offer&rsquo;d them
Peace, and Entertainment, as Subjects to the Emperor, who was so near
Ally&rsquo;d to the King of <i>Portugal</i>; protesting, That the
<i>Molucco</i> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name=
"pb17">17</a>]</span>Islands were within his Limits. This avail&rsquo;d
nothing, and <i>Daroes</i> Embarking in 12 <i>Carcoas</i>, with
<i>Emanuel Falcao</i>, sent that Protestation in Writing, and in case
it was Rejected, to declare War. The <i>Spanish</i> Commander
receiv&rsquo;d the Lawyer that was to make the Protestation, with much
Civility <span class="marginnote">Portuguese <i>and</i> Spanish
<i>War</i>.</span> and Respect, and answer&rsquo;d, That the
<i>Molucco</i> Islands belong&rsquo;d to the Crown of <i>Castile</i>,
and therefore he, in the Emperors Name, required <i>Don Garcia</i> not
to break the Peace establish&rsquo;d between their Kings. After all
they were oblig&rsquo;d to have recourse to Arms. <i>Iniguez</i> Landed
on <i>Tydore</i><span class="corr" id="xd21e2769" title=
"Not in source">,</span> strengthen&rsquo;d the Works, and
furnish&rsquo;d them with Canon. The <i>Portuguese</i> follow&rsquo;d,
and both sides Firing, there was a great Slaughter; but those of
<i>Ternate</i> retir&rsquo;d so disorderly, that the <i>Tydores</i>
remain&rsquo;d Victors. However neither the Protestations, nor the War
ceas&rsquo;d, the <i>Spaniards</i> urging <i>Magellan&rsquo;s</i>
Discovery, and the <i>Portuguese</i>, <i>Serrano&rsquo;s</i>, and
<i>Brito&rsquo;s</i>. The <i>Tydores</i> and <i>Spaniards</i> took some
<i>Carcoas</i> belonging to <i>Gilolo</i>, in which they kill&rsquo;d a
<i>Portuguese</i>, and some <i>Ternates</i>, as also a <i>Champan</i>
Laden with Provisions for <i>Talangame</i>.</p>
<p>In the <i>Philippine</i> Islands they give the Name of
<i>Carcoas</i> to a sort of <span class="marginnote">Carcoas, <i>what
sort of Vessels, and others</i>.</span> Vessels that use Oars, open,
and bigger than our Barks, and are Steer&rsquo;d by two Rudders, the
one ahead, and the other astern. The <i>Ternates</i> call&rsquo;d them
<i>Janguas</i>, which differ from the <i>Carcoas</i> only in having two
Half-Moons of Wood, Painted, or Guilt, rising above the Keel at the
Head and Poop. About 100 Men Row in each of them, to the sound of a
Tabor, and a Bell. They carry twenty Soldiers, and six Musketiers. The
rest are employ&rsquo;d about four or five little Brass Guns. Both the
Men that Row, and the Soldiers are Arm&rsquo;d with <i>Campilanes</i>,
that is <i>Cymiters</i>, and <i>Shields</i>, and abundance of
<i>Calabays</i>, and <i>Sagus</i>, being long Canes burnt in the Fire,
to harden them; which they throw, without tacking, as the <i>Moors</i>
do their Darts. Their way of Fighting is to come within Gun-shot, and
as soon as they have Fir&rsquo;d, both sides fly with all speed, till
they have Loaded again, and then return to the same Post. They set
three Men to each Gun, the one Levels, the other Charges, and the third
Fires it. This is the way among the Islanders; for when they have to do
with <i>Europeans</i>, our Example has Improv&rsquo;d them in the Art
of War. But in their <i>Carcoas</i> they are always expos&rsquo;d to be
kill&rsquo;d by our Cannon, because they have no Fights to cover them;
and the same is in the <i>Champanes</i>, which differ but little from
the others.</p>
<p>The Victory we have spoken of Encourag&rsquo;d the <i>Tydores</i>,
and with the Assistance of the <i>Spaniards</i>, they Arm&rsquo;d, and
falling upon <i>Gaca</i>, a Town of <i>Ternate</i>, Plunder&rsquo;d and
Burnt it; but at their Return, they met with <i>Martin Correa</i>, whom
they Fought, plying their <i>Carcoas</i>, the Success remaining
doubtful. Whilst this War was at the hottest, <i>Don George de
Meneses</i> <span class="marginnote">Don George de Meneses <i>at</i>
Ternate.</span> came from the <i>Papuas</i> to <i>Ternate</i>, to whom
<i>Don Garcia</i> presently resign&rsquo;d the Post, tho&rsquo; the
Hostilities continu&rsquo;d, with Burning and Slaughter on both sides,
which it was expected would be greater when the <i>Portuguese</i>
Succours came from <i>Malaca</i>, and the <i>Castilian</i> from
<i>Spain</i>. The new <i>Portuguese</i> Commander in Chief, and
<i>Martin Inniguez</i> came to a Conference, and with much Courtesy,
and desire of Peace, concluded a Truce, which lasted not long,
tho&rsquo; not on account of the main cause.</p>
<p>There were many Battles between the <i>Spanish</i> and
<i>Portuguese</i> Nations, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href=
"#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>from <i>Gilolo</i> and other adjacent
Islands, about the Possession of the <i>Moluccos</i>, and they were
under several Commanders, the Event whereof we shall see in its Place.
Therefore, and because others have Treated of them Copeously, they
shall be now pass&rsquo;d by, that we may return to the Actions of
those Kings, which ought to be distinctly deliver&rsquo;d now at the
Beginning, for the better Understanding of the Causes why they came to
be Lost.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>King of</i> Tydore <i>makes
Peace</i>.</span> The King of <i>Tydore</i> was less Supported by
<i>Spain</i> than he had been before, and was therefore oblig&rsquo;d
to sue for Peace, laying some Burden of Tribute, on his own Revenue
proceeding from the Cloves. He also promis&rsquo;d never to admit of
any <i>Spanish</i> Succours; besides some other Conditions, which put
an end to the Wars for a time.</p>
<p>We have already observ&rsquo;d, That <i>Cachil Boleyfe</i>, King of
<i>Ternate</i>, left three lawful Sons, <i>viz. Cachil Bayano</i>,
<i>Cachil Dayalo</i>, and <i>Cachil Tabarija</i>. The Eldest of them
was not above six Years of Age; besides whom there <span class=
"marginnote">Daroes, <i>and the Queen govern</i> Ternate.</span> were
seven Bastards, the Eldest of them, <i>Cachil Daroes</i>, was Governor
of the Kingdom, in Conjunction with the Queen. When <i>Brito</i>, in
the Year 1521, Built the Fort, to secure the Subjection of the Island,
tho&rsquo; he had another Pretence for it, he took the Infant King, and
the Queen his Mother, into it. She generously resenting this Violence,
as not able to endure, that they should oppose the course of her
Government, which she manag&rsquo;d, together with her Step-Son, loudly
Complain&rsquo;d, and Threatned, as a Queen, and as a Mother. She
wanted no Conveniencies for the Education of the Children; but there
being Wrong disguiz&rsquo;d among all that seeming Kindness, neither
her Family, nor the Nurse, nor the Perswasions of Great Persons, could
appease her Anger. The Natives observ&rsquo;d the Difference of the
<i>Portuguese</i> Domination, and that since their building of that
Fort, they us&rsquo;d intolerable Rigor, and consequently began to grow
cold in their Affection, <span class="marginnote">Portuguese
<i>Insolent</i>.</span> and to slacken in their Respect; especially
when they perceiv&rsquo;d that <i>Brito</i>&rsquo;s Successor
continu&rsquo;d to keep the Royal Family under Oppression. The young
King was bred up in the Fort, till he was of Age to enter upon the
Government of his Kingdom; and being 18 years old, soon dy&rsquo;d, not
without the usual suspition of Poison, but it was affirm&rsquo;d to be
given by private order of <i>Cachil Daroes</i>. O the wonderful Effects
of the Desire of Rule!</p>
<p>Sultan <i>Bayano</i> being Dead, order was taken that the People
should immediatly Swear <i>Cachil Dayalo</i>; but <i>Don George</i>
found also means to get him into the Fort; the Mother demanding him, as
fearing his Death, by the example of the Elder. <i>Don George</i>
condescended, not so much in compliance <span class=
"marginnote"><i>They Insult the Natives.</i></span> to her Fears, as to
oblige <i>Cachil Daroes</i>, with whose Government he was
well-satisfy&rsquo;d; and it was he that had interven&rsquo;d in, and
advis&rsquo;d that way of Breeding the Princes. Soon after there
happen&rsquo;d an Accident, which broke off their good Intelligence;
for <i>Daroes</i> grew jealous of the Commander in chiefs Behaviour,
observing him much to favour <i>Cachil Bayaco</i>, a Man of note, whose
Friendship he was suspicious of, and he with reason fear&rsquo;d, that
the Commander would in time value <i>Bayaco</i> more than him. This
well grounded Fear grew up in his Breast, till it turn&rsquo;d to down
right Hatred, and he contriv&rsquo;d to kill <i>Don George</i>. The
Design could not be carry&rsquo;d on so private, as to be
conceal&rsquo;d from him, and he to disappoint it, retir&rsquo;d into
the Fort. <i>Daroes</i> puffed up with the Applause of the People, sent
immediatly to require him to deliver up <i>Bayaco</i>, to try
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span>him upon some Complaints he had against him, being
his Judge, as Governour, and oblig&rsquo;d to do Justice. <i>Don
George</i> was desirous to save <i>Cachil Bayaco</i>, and to that
purpose assembled the <i>Alcayde</i>, and other Officers. Some said he
ought to deliver him, others advis&rsquo;d to appease <i>Daroes</i> by
fair means. <i>Bayaco</i>, who hated him so mortally, that he
woul&rsquo;d chuse any sort of Death, rather than fall into his Hands,
being lock&rsquo;d up in a Room of the Fort, understood that his Case
was doubtful, for they Consulted without any great Privacy. This made
him Resolve what to do, and going to a high Window, he threw himself
out with such Fury, that he beat himself to Pieces. <i>Don George</i>
was troubl&rsquo;d at the Accident, and thought himself oblig&rsquo;d
to Revenge it; which he began upon finding a Sow kill&rsquo;d, either
to spight him, or because the Neighbours were <i>Mahometans</i>, and
had done it as she graz&rsquo;d, or went about the Courts of the Fort.
This was a rediculous Occasion, but of Moment enough among those
People; Enquiry was made who had kill&rsquo;d her, and it
appear&rsquo;d, or <i>Don George</i> would have it, that the Fault
belong&rsquo;d to <i>Cachil Baydua</i>, a near Kinsman to <i>Cachil
Daroes</i>, very Learned, and Zealous in the Law of <i>Mahomet</i>, as
also a <i>Caciz</i>, or Priest, and of great Authority in the Kingdom.
He was seiz&rsquo;d by <i>Don George</i>, and carry&rsquo;d into the
Fort, without regard to the publick Peace. <i>Daroes</i>, in a great
Consternation, went with the chief Men of the Kingdom, to desire he
would release that Sacred Person. Whilst they were discoursing this
Point, <i>Peter Fernandez</i>, a mean Fellow, Servant to the Commander
in Chief, by his Masters Order, or of his own Accord, in the Presence
of them all, went up to <i>Cachil Baydua</i>, and rubb&rsquo;d his
Mouth, <span class="marginnote"><i>Rudeness.</i></span> and Face with a
fat Collop of the same Sow, neither the Opposition he made, nor his
Complaints to God, and the Commander in Chief availing him; but on the
contrary, the <i>Portugueses</i> laugh&rsquo;d out aloud, approving the
Action by their Applause. <i>Daroes</i> on his part, cast himself on
the Ground, and Weeping, prevail&rsquo;d to have <i>Baydua</i>
restor&rsquo;d to him, whom, <i>Don George</i> being <span class="corr"
id="xd21e3124" title="Source: sattsfy&rsquo;d">satisfy&rsquo;d</span>,
or appeas&rsquo;d, and taking Security, sent to his House.
<i>Daroes</i> attended him, and all the Prime Men; and <i>Baydua</i>,
by Reason it is an Abomination among them to touch Swines-Flesh,
presently used their Purifications; and the more to express his
Concern, voluntarily left the Island for some Years, and travel&rsquo;d
about all the others in the Neighbourhood, preaching, and magnifying
the Affront offer&rsquo;d to one of <i>Mahomets</i> Priests, thus
stirring up the Natives, and perswading them to Unite in Defence of
their Honour.</p>
<p>This Accident, which as a Disgrace to their Religion, exasperated
the People, was seconded by another much worse, which quite
render&rsquo;d the <i>Portugueses</i> Odious. The contrary Winds kept
back the Trading Galeon, <span class="marginnote">Portugueses <i>become
odious for Rapine</i>, &amp;c.</span> that us&rsquo;d to carry the
Soldiers Pay, and their Wants increasing, they began to seek Relief,
breaking into the Natives Shops, and Store-Houses, and taking away
their <span class="corr" id="xd21e3148" title=
"Source: Proviosins">Provisions</span>, without Paying for them.
<i>Daroes</i>, offended at it, order&rsquo;d, That no Provisions should
be brought into the City to sell, and that the Shops which dealt in
them, should be shut up. This was accordingly done, and reduc&rsquo;d
those in the Fort to such Distress, that the Soldiers mutinying,
rail&rsquo;d at their own Commander, and the Governour of <i>India</i>,
demanding Relief with their Arms in their Hands. <i>Don George</i>
being hard press&rsquo;d, and blaming the Avarice of his Country Men,
sent some <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=
"pb20">20</a>]</span><i>Carcoas</i> with Soldiers, under the Command of
<i>Gomez Ariaz</i>, to barter Goods in the adjacent Islands for
Provisions. They Landed on an Island near by, where, being desperate
with Hunger, they Plunder&rsquo;d the Town of <i>Tabona</i>, the
Inhabitants whereof, no longer able to endure such Affronts, and
Robberies, running to Arms, fell upon them, and kill&rsquo;d the
greatest Number, and most of the rest being Wounded, were
Disarm&rsquo;d. They embark&rsquo;d for <i>Ternate</i>, where their
Wounds and Nakedness spoke what had befallen them, as much as their
Words. <i>Don George</i>, who, besides his being naturally Passionate,
was now quite enrag&rsquo;d, threatned <i>Daroes</i>, That if he did
not deliver up the principal Actors in this Mischief, he would seek his
Revenge other ways. He was obey&rsquo;d, and tho&rsquo; <i>Cachil
Daroes</i> knew that all the Fault belong&rsquo;d to the
<i>Portugueses</i>, yet he deliver&rsquo;d up the Governor of
<i>Tabona</i>, and two other Chief Men of the Place, to <i>Don
George</i>, thinking he would be satisfy&rsquo;d with keeping them
Prisoners for <span class="marginnote"><i>Barbarous Cruelty.</i></span>
some Days. As soon as they were brought before him, he order&rsquo;d
the Hands of the two to be cut off, and that they should be then set at
liberty. The Governors Punishment was answerable to the Cruelty of him
that was his Judge; they ty&rsquo;d his Hands behind his Back, and
exposing him on the Shore, set two fierce Woolf-Dogs upon him, he
having no way to withstand their Fury, made several vain attempts to
slip aside from them, and endeavour&rsquo;d to defend himself with what
little Power was left him in those Limbs that were not Bound. The
Multitude with Horror beheld the Spectacle, touch&rsquo;d with
Compassion, and admiring the Inhumanity of the Punishment. The wretched
Man attempted to Fly, but perceiving that the arm&rsquo;d Soldiers, had
shut up every way, on the Land side, he cast himself into the Sea, the
only Refuge accidentally left him, to seek some uncertain Hope of
Safety. However the Dogs being already blooded, left him not; but
barking and howling, bit and tore him, tho&rsquo; he still swam with
his Legs. At last, being desperate, and almost in the last Agony, he
took a horrid Resolution and fell upon those fierce Creatures with his
Teeth; such was the Effect of Pain and Despair. Thus the unhappy Man
took hold of one of the Dogs by the Ear, and holding fast, sunk with
him to the Bottom. The like Barbarity had never before been seen in any
of those Countries to which the <i>Portugueses</i> Traded; and by it
they lost the Reputation they had before gain&rsquo;d, to their great
Applause, that they inflicted Punishments, as it were by Compulsion,
and Oblig&rsquo;d to it, and that with Mildness, and Compassion, to
shew their Generosity.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Conspiracy to destroy the</i>
Portugueses.</span> This Action brought them into general Hatred, and
all the People of the <i>Molucco</i> Islands being exited by <i>Cachil
Daroes</i>, contriv&rsquo;d to kill <i>Don George</i>, with all the
<i>Portugueses</i> and <i>Spaniards</i>, and so deliver themselves from
their Yoke. <i>Daroes</i> undertook to Unite all the Kings of those
Islands in a League against the Christians; sent away trusty Persons to
stir up the Confederates; and particularly to <i>Cachil Catabruno</i>,
Governor of <i>Gilolo</i>, during that Kings Minority, advising him, at
a Time appointed, to rise in Arms against the <i>Spaniards</i>
inhabiting his Dominions, and then to kill the Infant King, and Usurp
the Crown; for the compassing whereof he promis&rsquo;d his Assistance,
for they should both make that their common Cause, because he
design&rsquo;d the same Slaughter upon the <i>Portugueses</i>, and upon
the Infant King <i>Sultan Dayalo</i>, whom he would Succeed in the
Throne, and never submit <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href=
"#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span>to any <i>Spanish</i> Tyranny. At
this time the Voice of the Gospel resounded in the Ears of the
Barbarous Nations of the <i>Archipelago</i>, by the Preaching of the
Religious Men of the Orders of St. <i>Augustin</i>, St.
<i>Dominick</i>, and St. <i>Francis</i>, and of Father <i>Francis
Naverius</i>, a <i>Jesuit</i>, and his Companions; Churches were built,
and therefore God, who was taught by them, would not suffer the
Ministers of the Gospel to be extirpated. <i>Don George</i> was
inform&rsquo;d of the Conspiracy, and the Preparations that were making
to put it in Execution, which he kept to himself. <i>Daroes</i>, the
better to disemble it, never absented himself, but resorted to the
Fort, and paid Visits to the Governour; sometimes when sent for by him,
and others, of his own Accord. He sent one Day desiring he would come
to him, and bring <i>Cachil Tamarano</i>, Admiral of the Island, and
<i>Cachil Boio</i>, the chief Justice of the Kingdom, to treat about
some important Affairs. <i>Cachil Daroes</i> knowing nothing of <i>Don
George</i>&rsquo;s Design, took those two <i>Cachils</i> with him, and
went away to the Fort. <i>Don George</i> receiv&rsquo;d them
courteously, <span class="marginnote"><span class="corr" id="xd21e3292"
title="Source: Doroes">Daroes</span> <i>and others put to
Death</i>.</span> and with a chearful Countenance; but being come into
a Room where all Things were prepar&rsquo;d for the Purpose, they were
seiz&rsquo;d and put to the Rack, on which they discover&rsquo;d the
Conspiracy. Immediately he pass&rsquo;d Sentence upon them in Form, and
at the same time caus&rsquo;d a Scaffold to be erected, adjoyning to
the Fort, on the Outside, where the People were already gather&rsquo;d
in a Crowd. Then <i>Cachil Daroes</i> being brought out, and
plac&rsquo;d high on the Scaffold, a Cryer proclaim&rsquo;d his Crimes,
and the Penalty he was condemn&rsquo;d to. His Head was cut off, and
his Companions put to a less honourable Death; but what that was, no
History or Relations inform us.</p>
<p>The Queen and all the Natives, were so terrify&rsquo;d by this
Action, that <span class="marginnote"><i>Natives fly, and streighten
the</i> Portugueses.</span> they fled out of the City, to a craggy
strong Mountain at the Town of <i>Toruto</i>: Thence the Queen sent to
demand her Son, whom the Governour kept as a Prisoner; but he not
answering her Letter, she was so offended at, and jealous of his
Silence, that she caus&rsquo;d Proclamation to be made, forbidding all
the People of the Island, upon Pain of Death, to sell any Provisions,
or other Necessaries, to the <i>Portugueses</i>. Her Orders were
readily obey&rsquo;d, and the <i>Portugueses</i> press&rsquo;d by
Hunger, found it a more powerful Enemy, than those they had
wrong&rsquo;d. Their Skins began to shrivel, they grew Lank and Weak,
and must have perish&rsquo;d, had not <i>Gonzalo Pereyra</i>
arriv&rsquo;d then with the Trading Galeon. <i>Gonzalo Pereyra</i> came
from <i>Malaca</i> to succeed <i>Don George de Meneses</i> in the Post
of <i>Ternate</i>; and improving the Opportunity, touch&rsquo;d at
<i>Borneo</i>, where he visited the King, with whom, the
<i>Spaniards</i> not obstructing, he settled perpetual Peace and Amity;
thence he set out immediately for <i>Ternate</i>, where he
arriv&rsquo;d in Safety. He presently took Possession of the Fort, and
paid the weak Soldiers. The Queen <span class="corr" id="xd21e3344"
title="Source: sent">went</span> to visit him, and to complain of
<i>Don George</i>, <span class="marginnote"><i>New
Governour.</i></span> and demand her Son <i>Cachil Dayalo</i>, which
was her greatest Concern. <i>Gonzalo Pereyra</i> answer&rsquo;d her
generously, promis&rsquo;d to do her Justice; and to begin,
secur&rsquo;d <i>Don George</i> in the Principal Tower, to appease the
Queen, engaging i i. Word, That he would restore her Son, as soon as
the Fort was in a good Posture. He sent to intreat her to return to the
City, and former Amity; that Justice might be peaceably
administer&rsquo;d. She seeing some Effects of his Promise, in the
Imprisonment of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name=
"pb22">22</a>]</span>her Enemy, and the Expectation of Releasing the
King her Son, turn&rsquo;d past Sorrow into Joy, return&rsquo;d to
Court, and <i>Gonzalo Pereyra</i> reform&rsquo;d Abuses, repair&rsquo;d
the Fort, and built Bastions of Square Stone, which till then had been
unhew&rsquo;d, the Queen furnishing Workmen and Materials. Still
<i>Cachil Dayalo</i> was detain&rsquo;d in the Fort, without being
restor&rsquo;d to his Liberty; and the Queen and People help&rsquo;d to
build the Fort, as the sure Means of obtaining their King&rsquo;s
Liberty. <i>Gonzalo Pereyra</i>, when he thought it a proper Time,
resolv&rsquo;d to execute some Orders he had brought from <i>Goa</i>,
which were the same that had before endanger&rsquo;d the Disturbance of
those Kingdoms.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Fresh Uproars caus&rsquo;d by the
Governour.</i></span> Some Governours, says the <i>Portuguese</i>
Historian, <i>Couto</i>, only study to enrich themselves, impoverishing
the Provinces, and their King; for no Prince can be rich, if his
Grandeur depends upon poor Subjects. The Governour now perceiving that
all Things were quiet, and he had little or no Dependance on those
People, made Proclamation, that none should buy Cloves in those
Islands, but the King, his Master&rsquo;s Factors. At the same Time he
order&rsquo;d, that his Officers should enter the Houses of
marry&rsquo;d Men, which are the Richest, and take away all their
Cloves; and this not only among the Natives, but in the Habitations,
and Colonies of the <i>Portugueses</i>, paying for it after the Country
Rate; and that they should break all their Weights, Scales and
Measures, and other Implements of this Sort, all which he caus&rsquo;d
to be publickly burnt. The Island was again in an Uproar, and the
<i>Portugueses</i> were for quitting it, because it was to no Purpose
to live there, if they were depriv&rsquo;d of that Trade. Most of the
<i>Portugueses</i> repair&rsquo;d to the House of <i>Ferdinand
Lopez</i>, a Priest, who was the Bishop&rsquo;s Vicar in the Fort, and
ought to have given them an Example of Modesty. There one <i>Vincent
Fonseca</i>, a seditious Fellow, heading the Mutiniers, they
resolv&rsquo;d to require the Governour to permit them to live in their
former Liberty; and in case he should not Consent, they would depart
the Fort, and the Country, and go over to the <i>Spaniards</i>, or else
to the <i>Mahometans</i>, and Idolaters Towns. Some there were, who
boggled at the Crime of abandoning the Service of their King, together
with the <span class="marginnote">Portugueses <i>mutiny</i>.</span>
Fort; and voted it would be less Harm to procure the Governour&rsquo;s
Death, by Means of the Natives. Whilst they were thus unresolv&rsquo;d,
the Governour sent to seize <i>Vincent de Fonseca</i>, for some
disrespectful Words he had spoken upon this Occasion, to another
Soldier who was viewing the Guards. The Multitude, who had already
given themselves up to the Direction of <i>Fonseca</i>, were as much
concern&rsquo;d at his Imprisonment, as if every one of them had been
put into Irons; and as generally in such Mutinies, they are not without
some specious Pretence, tho&rsquo; it be but superficial, many of the
Seditious, being incens&rsquo;d, and resolute, repair&rsquo;d to the
Queen&rsquo;s Palace, where they were easily admitted, and some of them
to more Privacy with certain Counsellors of her&rsquo;s. There they
represented the Hardship of depriving them of the Trade of Clove,
without any Demerit on their Side. <i>But</i>, said they, <i>they may
as well deprive us of this common Air, of this Light, and of the
Benefit of our Senses. Our Kings give no such Orders; but they proceed
from the Avarice of the Governours and Commanders, who tyrannize over
us, and this Man more than all his Predecessors, being come to destroy,
that which he was sent to preserve. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23"
href="#pb23" name="pb23">23</a>]</span>He has no Design to restore your
Majesty your Son; but on the contrary we are satisfy&rsquo;d he
contrives to destroy both the Son and the Mother. Her he will secure,
as soon as he has brought his Works to perfection, that he may not be
again kept from Provisions. If you will stand up for your Country, and
kill the Commander, we shall not obstruct it, but on the contrary shall
be as vigorous to act against him, as we are ready to promise
it.</i></p>
<p>The Queen and her Councellors were well pleas&rsquo;d, hoping by
that <span class="marginnote"><i>The Queen stirs up her
People.</i></span> means to get rid of Tyrants, as they call&rsquo;d
them, and therefore would not let slip so favourable an opportunity to
compass their Ends. The Queen assembled the prime Men of the Island;
represented to them the Condition it was in; put them in mind, how King
<i>Boleyfe</i> her Husband, protected the <i>Portugueses</i>, who came
thither in Distress; how they had sworn Amity, and solemnly given their
Hands upon it; the Honour and Kindness he show&rsquo;d them; and that
for their sakes he forfeited the good will of the Neighbouring Princes;
that after he had receiv&rsquo;d them, he maintain&rsquo;d Wars, and
sustain&rsquo;d losses, even to the hazard of his life, to protect
them; that he treated them as affectionately as if they had been his
own Children; and how they, in return for his Entertainment and
Favours, <i>as soon as the Breath was out of his Body,
presum&rsquo;d</i>, said she, <i>to lay violent Hands on me; from whose
Tyranny and Oppression I escaped, by absconding long among the Rocks,
and Brambles. My Children, they snatch&rsquo;d from their Nurses
Breasts, to confine them in Prison; in their own Kingdom, and among
their Subjects. When</i> Cachil Bayano <i>came to age to govern, they
poyson&rsquo;d him. They now design after the same manner to destroy
his Brother, a lawful King, as if he were some run-away Slave. See what
regard a parcel of intruding Strangers have for your Fortunes, your
Houses, your Daughters, and your Wives, in your own Country, and in my
Presence. Any one of these things ought to be a sufficient motive to
cast off the Yoke we laid upon our Necks through our own Credulity.
What then will not they all together oblige us to do? But besides all
this, what ought we not to do, seeing our Religion affronted? Our
Temples polluted? Our Priests trampled on? And all our selves in
general despis&rsquo;d? Can you have a greater Testimony of the justice
of your Cause, than to see the</i> Portugueses <i>themselves on your
side? Do not let slip this Opportunity, my Friends, stand by them,
since they promise to assist us. Deliver by their means your King, your
Country, and your Religion; that all these may be afterwards
rescu&rsquo;d from them, and we may exclude such ungrateful
Guests.</i></p>
<p>These and other Exhortations made by the Queen, as <i>Mafeus</i>
writes in <span class="marginnote"><i>Conspiracy against the
Governor.</i></span> his <i>Latin</i> History, were receiv&rsquo;d with
Abundance of Tears, and they all engag&rsquo;d to put their helping
hands to the execution of what had been concerted; and fixt the day and
hour. Great Dissimulation was us&rsquo;d, and the Queen forwarded the
work of the Fort with much application, without sparing any Cost,
giving out, so as it might come to the Governour&rsquo;s Ears, That the
King her Sons Liberty depended on the finishing of the Fort. This was
the effect of Motherly Affection. The appointed Day being come, the
Natives appear&rsquo;d in Arms, just during the scorching Heat of the
Noon-day; Some hid themselves in a Mosque, behind the Fort; others in a
Wood, not far off, all of them ready to assault it, upon a Signal
given, they being to enter at a Breach, which was not yet made up. Some
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name=
"pb24">24</a>]</span>of the Arm&rsquo;d Islanders slily mixt themselves
among the Masons, and Labourers, and among the King&rsquo;s Servants,
who were going and coming with kind Messages between the Son and the
Mother, and by this means convey&rsquo;d him his Arms, and being
us&rsquo;d to talk to him freely at other times, they had then the
Opportunity of acquainting him with the Design, and advising to be in a
readiness to fall on boldly in due time. Thence they went to the
Governour&rsquo;s Apartment, where he was taking his Afternoons Nap in
all possible Security, his whole Family being asleep. The
<i>Ternates</i> burst the Doors open with their Shoulders, and
rush&rsquo;d upon the Governour, whom the noise had awak&rsquo;d. He
defended himself with his Sword and Buckler for a considerable space;
but his Enemies being numerous, and all <span class="marginnote"><i>His
Death.</i></span> pressing forwards, they cut him in pieces. A
Woman-slave of his hearing the Hubbub, shreek&rsquo;d out, which with
the other Noise brought the Islanders out of the Mosque, without
expecting the Signal. They laid hold of a <i>Portuguese</i> they met,
but he broke loose, and escap&rsquo;d their Fury by flight. The Slave
continu&rsquo;d crying out, <i>Moors, Moors</i>. With this the
Governour&rsquo;s Servants came running arm&rsquo;d, and going up to
the chief Tower, where their Master was wont to divert himself, found
all the Murderers there, whom they laid hold of, and cast down
headlong, and then shut the Gates of the Fort. Then they rang the Bell,
the sound whereof, and their not hearing the Signal, discourag&rsquo;d
the <i>Ternates</i> who lay in Ambush, so that they slunk away into the
City.</p>
<p>The <i>Portugues</i> Conspirators went slily dissembling into the
Fort, and finding the Governour dead, requir&rsquo;d the rest in his
place to admit of the <i>Alcayde</i>, or Constable of the Fort, because
the King of <i>Portugal</i> had so order&rsquo;d. They refus&rsquo;d
him, and particularly the Vicar, who took upon him <span class=
"marginnote">Fonseca <i>made Governour</i>.</span> to head them all,
and prevail&rsquo;d so far that they chose <i>Vincent de Fonseca</i>
for their Governour, who immediately took Possession of the Fort, and
beginning to go on in the Tyrannical Design of <i>Gonzalo Pereyra</i>,
left the Trade of Clove as it was before; but secur&rsquo;d King
<i>Dayalo</i>. No notice was taken of the Governour&rsquo;s Death, as
being executed by the consent of them all. The Queen insisted to demand
her Son, since she had furnish&rsquo;d all Necessaries for that Work;
<i>Vincent Fonseca</i> refer&rsquo;d the Answer to the Marry&rsquo;d
Men. All those Nations are of opinion that the discreetest among them
are the Marry&rsquo;d Men, both on account of their Age, and as more
faithful Councellors, because they have a greater interest in the
publick Good, and therefore it is usual to refer to them all Debates
and Answers in matters of Difficulty. They all voted, That the Queen
should not have her Son deliver&rsquo;d to her, because it was
convenient to keep him as an Hostage, fearing the second part of what
had been concerted, and that their Friendships would last no longer
than till it could be executed. But to palliate the true cause of
detaining him, they answered, That they must first acquaint the
Governour of <i>India</i>. In the mean while the Mother did not cease
to weep, and to intreat. She fed upon these Hopes, grounded on the
Hatred the <i>Portugueses</i> still retain&rsquo;d for <i>Pereyra</i>,
and on the Generosity she had us&rsquo;d in restoring the Trade of
Clove, and other means. The most prevalent of these seem&rsquo;d to be
the gaining the affections of the Marry&rsquo;d <i>Portugueses</i>, to
whom that Affair was referred, and under-hand of <i>Vincent Fonseca</i>
himself, by rich Presents, and extraordinary Gifts. But she was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span>soon undeceived, for <i>Fonseca</i> offered her
such Reasons or Excuses, as proved his Tyrannical Design; alledging,
that having already sent to consult the Governour of <i>India</i> about
the King&rsquo;s Liberty, it was not in his power to come to any
Resolution in that affair, till the Answer came from <i>Goa</i>, for
they would cut off his Head, should he go about to act of himself. The
Queen perceiving that neither Gifts, nor Intreaties would prevail to
get her Son, she resolv&rsquo;d to use Force.</p>
<p>She stir&rsquo;d up all the Neighbouring Kingdoms against the
<i>Portugueses</i>; <span class="marginnote"><i>The Queen recovers her
Son by force.</i></span> and order&rsquo;d the Provisions to be all
remov&rsquo;d, that none might come to the Fort, either by Sea or Land.
Those within began to feel the want of all Necessaries, to such a
degree, that they su&rsquo;d to the Queen for Peace, which was
concluded, and they gave up her Son, which was the only thing she
aim&rsquo;d at, without regarding the inconveniency of losing the Fort.
The Queen having obtain&rsquo;d the King&rsquo;s Liberty, granted the
<i>Portugueses</i> all the Conditions they demanded, and was so
throughly appeas&rsquo;d that the Christians continu&rsquo;d their
Settlements and Colonies, and Trade, and Provisions were
restor&rsquo;d. The Queen put the Government into the hands of her Son,
who at first shew&rsquo;d some Severity and Harshness towards the prime
Men, and discover&rsquo;d some Weaknesses, which till then his
Confinement had either conceal&rsquo;d, or suppress&rsquo;d. These
things render&rsquo;d him so odious, that the case was alter&rsquo;d,
and they would have been glad he had been Prisoner again. The Mother
could not curb his ill Inclination, for the extravagant Youth&rsquo;s
deprav&rsquo;d Nature would not allow of it.</p>
<p>At this time three mean Fellows of the <i>Portugueses</i> Colony,
went to those of the Natives to rob; besides which they ravish&rsquo;d
some Women. The <span class="marginnote">Portuguese <i>Robbers
kill&rsquo;d</i>.</span> Islanders would not bear with that Insolence;
but those who had been wrong&rsquo;d in revenge kill&rsquo;d the
Offenders. <i>Vincent de Fonseca</i> hearing of it, magnify&rsquo;d the
Heinousness of the Fact, without mentioning his Countrymens Guilt, and
order&rsquo;d strict Enquiry to be made after the Slayers. What Care
ought Princes to take to secure the Affection of their Subjects. The
King was so hated, that certain Natives went to the Governour, and
being conducted into a private part of the Fort, because they were Men
of Quality, they assur&rsquo;d him that the King had been the Occasion
of the killing of those <i>Portugueses</i>, grounding the Accusation on
their own Surmises, and aggravating the Offence with other
Circumstances, in such manner, that had <i>Fonseca</i> lov&rsquo;d the
King, he could not but have believ&rsquo;d them. He presently
contriv&rsquo;d to seize him; but being impatient, and despairing of
securing him by Art, had recourse to Force. The King did the like,
tho&rsquo; <span class="marginnote"><i>King of</i> Ternate
<i>flies</i>.</span> sensible how little Assistance he could expect
from his People, however he arm&rsquo;d a few Vessels, and falling upon
some Christian Towns, took several Prisoners. The Governour on the
other Hand, without sparing <i>Ternate</i>, attacked what Towns he
could, so that Cruelty and Rapine were again in use, even to assaulting
of Cities, the very Sufferers approving of it, and pleas&rsquo;d with
their Losses, that so they might be reveng&rsquo;d of their King. He
fearing that the Hatred they bore him, might occasion his being
seiz&rsquo;d and deliver&rsquo;d up to <i>Fonseca</i>, went over to
<i>Tydore</i>, where that King for the present entertain&rsquo;d and
assisted him, as a Friend and Relation. The Governour sent with speed
to call the King&rsquo;s younger Brother, named <i>Sultan Tabarija</i>,
who was fled with some Malecontents, and with the consent of

King.</span> all the rest of the People, who were before no less
dissatisfy&rsquo;d, proclaim&rsquo;d him King, with all the Forms and
Ceremonies us&rsquo;d in that case. Many approv&rsquo;d of it, yet some
were scandaliz&rsquo;d. The same Division reign&rsquo;d among the
<i>Portugueses</i>, remembring the unjust Election of <i>Vincent de
Fonseca</i>, and that he was the first and main instrument of the Death
of <i>Gonzalo Pereyra. Fonseca</i> himself was not at Peace with his
own Conscience; but so full of Apprehensions and Dread, that he was
never unarm&rsquo;d, disconsolate, melancholy, and attended by all
those ill Symptoms, the Memory of Guilt produces in the Mind; and he
could wish he were discharg&rsquo;d of the Burden he had taken upon
him. The new King <i>Tabarija</i> began his Reign shewing Kindness to
all Men, and cherishing the <i>Portugueses</i>, which offended his
absent Brother; and administer&rsquo;d occasion to irritate the Kings
of <i>Tydore</i> and <i>Ternate</i> against him so hastily, that he
immediately broke the Peace, and declar&rsquo;d himself their
Enemy.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Tristan de Atayde <i>Governour of</i>
Ternate.</span> At this time <i>Tristan de Atayde</i> came to
<i>Ternate</i>, whose Presence brought all Things into better Form. He
appeas&rsquo;d the Queen, and commending <i>Tabarija&rsquo;s</i>
Government, gain&rsquo;d his Affection. Trade went on without any
Obstruction. <i>Vincent de Fonseca</i> imbark&rsquo;d for <i>India</i>,
and was seiz&rsquo;d by the Viceroy of <i>Goa</i>, for the heinous
Crimes he had committed in the <i>Molucco</i> Islands, whence a full
Account of them was sent with him; yet he was not punish&rsquo;d, but
liv&rsquo;d quietly for the future. <i>Ternate</i> flourish&rsquo;d
under this mild Government; the King, his Subjects, and the
<i>Portuguese</i> Officers being united; but all those Garrisons so
remote from the Head, being Receptacles of seditious Persons, who are
contriving Innovations to disturb the Peace, and thrive by Discord,
there wanted not some Promoters of such Changes, who perverted
<i>Tristan de Atayde</i>, and divested him of his former Mildness.
About the beginning of his Government two <i>Carcoas</i> of Barbarians
plunder&rsquo;d and almost destroy&rsquo;d the City <i>Momoya</i>, the
Inhabitants whereof were Idolaters, in the Island <i>Moro</i>. The Lord
of it a powerful <i>Sangiack</i>, and good Moral Man, tho&rsquo; a
Heathen, made his Escape. <i>Gonzalo Velloso</i>, a <i>Portuguese</i>,
was then not far from his City, following his Trade, and going thither,
upon his paying a Visit to the <i>Sangiack</i>, he told him the Havock
that had been made, complaining of the dangerous Neighbourhood of the
other Islanders, and asking his Advice, how he might be reveng&rsquo;d
and secur&rsquo;d for the future. <i>Velloso</i>, God directing his
Tongue, told him, That the surest way was to sue for Peace to the
Commander in chief of the <i>Moluccos</i>, and entertain Amity with the
<i>Portugueses</i>, for if his Enemies once saw he was supported by
their Power, no King nor <i>Sangiack</i> would dare to offend him. He
assur&rsquo;d him that the King of <i>Portugal</i> sent them for that
End, being oblig&rsquo;d to put down Tyranny and Oppression; but that
for the obtaining that benefit more fully, it was requisite he should
become a Christian; for by that means he would save his Soul, and
secure his Escape, which was the least important of the <span class=
"marginnote"><i>A Sangiack converted.</i></span> two. <i>Velloso</i>
said so much to this Point, and the Spirit which directed, suggested
such important Truths, that the <i>Sangiack</i> at first admiring them,
approv&rsquo;d and submitted to them, and grew very earnest to be
admitted to Baptism. He desir&rsquo;d <i>Gonzalo Velloso</i> to be
assisting to him, and gathering some of his Family and Friends, they
set out for <i>Ternate</i>, the <i>Sangiack</i> himself staying behind
for their Answer. The Heathens came with <i>Velloso</i> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span>to
<i>Ternate</i>, where they were generously received, and
entertain&rsquo;d by <i>Tristan de Ataide</i>. Having heard what they
came about, he put them all into the Christian Habit, appointing
Clergy-men to instruct and Catechize them. Being thus prepar&rsquo;d,
they receiv&rsquo;d Baptism with extraordinary satisfaction, the
Commander in chief being their God-father. Then he commended the
<i>Sangiack</i>&rsquo;s Resolution, shewing how advantageous it would
be to him to become a Son of the Church, and reject the abominable and
foul Ceremonies of Idolatry, in which he had liv&rsquo;d. He sent him
word, to appoint the Day and Place for being Baptiz&rsquo;d, and he
would see all perform&rsquo;d as he should direct, for which Reason he
left it to his Choice. The Messengers returning to <i>Momoya</i>, were
not only proud of having embrac&rsquo;d the Christian Faith, but of the
good Usage they receiv&rsquo;d from the Governour and other Christians,
telling the <i>Sangiack</i> all that had happen&rsquo;d, and the Answer
they brought him. The <i>Sangiack</i>, led by his own inclination, and
encourag&rsquo;d by their Account, imbark&rsquo;d in some
<i>Carcoas</i> with the greatest Splendor of Musick and Gayety he was
able. Being come in Sight of <i>Ternate</i>, <i>Tristan de Ataide</i>
went out to meet him with no less Pomp. He lodg&rsquo;d and
entertain&rsquo;d him accordingly, and order&rsquo;d a Learned and
Religious Man to Catechize and instruct him. Some Days after when the
Cathecumens were fitted for it, they receiv&rsquo;d Baptism, with
publick Rejoycings, and greater Solemnity than had ever been seen in
<i>Ternate</i>. There was not a Christian but what brought
Palm-Branches and Flowers from that natural Garden of the Island;
besides Musick, Dancing, Firing of great Guns, and even the very
Barbarians rejoyc&rsquo;d. The <i>Sangiack</i> in Baptism took the Name
of <i>Don John</i>; he stay&rsquo;d some Days rejoycing and Feasting
with the <i>Portugueses</i>, and then return&rsquo;d home, taking along
with him the Priest that instructed him, call&rsquo;d <i>Simon Vaz</i>,
to improve him in the Knowledge of the Faith. That Priest liv&rsquo;d
with him some Years in his City, leading an Exemplar Life, and
exercising himself in Works of Officious and pure Charity, by which
means he converted great Numbers of Heathens, and particularly the
Inhabitants of <i>Momoya</i>. But being alone, and the Number of those
God was pleased for his Glory, to bring to him increasing very fast, he
sent to <i>Tristan de Atayde</i> for another Priest to assist him in
that Function, and he accordingly sent <i>F. Francis Alvarez</i>. They
both in a short time converted the Infidels of that Part, throwing down
all the <i>Pagodes</i>, so they call&rsquo;d their Idols, cleansing
those Places, and converting the Houses of Abomination and Darkness
into Churches of the living God. <i>Tristan de Atayde</i> so far
favour&rsquo;d the new <i>Don John</i>, as to send along with him some
<i>Portuguese</i> Soldiers to defend his Person and Fort, and this
Prince maintain&rsquo;d very friendly Correspondence with him. His End
we shall soon see and admire in the Sequel of this History.</p>
<p>The People of <i>Ternate</i> at the same time took another Course,
for they <span class="marginnote">Portugueses <i>serve the
King</i>.</span> hating <i>Sultan Tabarija</i>, and desiring his Death,
talk&rsquo;d with the Governour in private, and gave him to understand
that his Life was in Danger, for <i>Tabarija</i> contriv&rsquo;d to
kill him, as had been done by <i>Gonzalo Pereyra</i>, that so he might
seize the Fort, turning out the <i>Portugueses</i>. The Governour
hearing his Life, and the Fort were both in Jeopardy, and calling to
mind the yet fresh Example of his Predecessor, easily believ&rsquo;d
the Design, but cunningly dissembled. He contriv&rsquo;d that some
<i>Portugueses</i> on account <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href=
"#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span>of real or pretended Differences
should have Recourse to the King&rsquo;s Favour, as sometimes they
us&rsquo;d to do, and should prevail upon him to come to the Fort to
speak for them. He was apply&rsquo;d to by some, and like an innocent
Man suspecting nothing, went to the Fort to intercede for them. He was
immediately seiz&rsquo;d and loaded with Irons, and being brought to
Trial, the same Persons that contriv&rsquo;d his Imprisonment,
appear&rsquo;d as Witnesses against him. After a tedious Examination,
or show of it, the Result was, that he should be sent to <i>India</i>
to justifie himself. He imbark&rsquo;d with a safe <span class=
"marginnote"><i>His Conversion and Death.</i></span> Conscience, and
his Cause being examin&rsquo;d before the Viceroy <i>Antony Barreto</i>
at <i>Goa</i>, he was clear&rsquo;d, and confessing the Holy Spirit had
taken that method to draw him to Salvation, was Baptiz&rsquo;d in that
City with great Satisfaction, by the Name of <i>Don Emanuel</i>. In his
Return homewards, expecting the <i>Monson</i> at <i>Malaca</i> to put
to Sea, he dy&rsquo;d with extraordinary Tokens of a sincere Christian;
and having no lawful Heir, appointed King <i>John</i> the Third of
<i>Portugal</i> to succeed him in all his Kingdoms. The Will was
afterwards carry&rsquo;d to <i>Ternate</i>, where the great Ones and
Commonalty accepted of it, owning King <i>John</i> for their Soveraign.
This was perform&rsquo;d with Acclamations in the Streets and publick
Places, as also in the Courts of Judicature, taking Possession with the
Royal Standard of <i>Portugal</i> display&rsquo;d, and all other usual
Solemnities and Ceremonies. In the Year 1549, <i>Jordan de Freytas</i>
carry&rsquo;d the publick Instruments of the Possession to
<i>Lisbon</i>.</p>
<p>To return to the Course of the History when <i>Tristan de Atayde</i>
had Imbark&rsquo;d King <i>Tabarija</i> for <i>India</i>, he sought out
for a Bastard Brother of his call&rsquo;d <i>Aerio</i>, born of a
<i>Javanese</i> Mother. The Lad was then ten years of Age, bred by his
Mother in a retir&rsquo;d manner, at a Pleasure-House encompass&rsquo;d
with perpetual Greens, the natural Disposition being improv&rsquo;d
<span class="marginnote"><i>The Melancholy Tree, and Flower.</i></span>
by Art, which so far prevail&rsquo;d that the Flower so wonderful for
its <span class="corr" id="xd21e3902" title=
"Source: Fragancy">Fragrancy</span> and manner of growing call&rsquo;d
<i>Triste</i>, or melancholy; found only in <i>Malabar</i> and
<i>Malaca</i>, abounded in this Ladies Gardens. She ador&rsquo;d the
Sun, and brought up her Child in that Folly, that he might forget the
Rudiments he learnt at <i>Goa</i>, when in the Colledge of the
<i>Jesuits</i>. The Idolaters believe, or feign, that a most beautiful
Daughter of <i>Parizataco</i>, a <i>Satrapa</i>, or Nobleman, fell in
love with the Sun, and that he after complying with, and obliging her,
setled his Affections on another, and the first not able to endure that
another should be preferr&rsquo;d before her, kill&rsquo;d her self.
From her Ashes, for in those parts they still retain the Custom of
burning dead Bodies, sprung that <i>Melancholy Tree</i>, say they,
whose Blossoms or Flowers still preserving the Memory of their
Original, have such a Hatred for the Sun, that they cannot bear his
Light. This Plant is call&rsquo;d in the <i>Canarine</i> Tongue
<i>Parizataco</i>, from the <i>Indian</i> Womans Father, who was
Metamorphos&rsquo;d like <i>Daphne</i>, tho&rsquo; on other Account.
The <i>Malayes</i> call it <i>Singadi</i>; the <i>Arabs</i>,
<i>Guart</i>; the <i>Persians</i> and <i>Turks</i>, <i>Gul</i>; the
<i>Decanines</i>, <i>Pul</i>; and the <i>Portuguese</i>, <i>Arvore
Triste</i>; that is, the Melancholy Tree. It shoots out abundance of
slender Branches, regularly divided by Knots, from each of which two
Leaves sprout, opposite to one another, like those of the Plum-Tree,
but soft like Sage, and cover&rsquo;d with a white Down. From each Leaf
sprouts a Nib, or Nipple, whence five Heads shoot out small at the end,
each of them adorn&rsquo;d with four smaller <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span>round
Leaves; from each little Head proceed five Flowers, the fifth in the
midst of the other four; among them the white Flowers visibly grow out,
being bigger than Orange Flowers, and so fast after Night fall, that
the Motion of them is perceptible. This Fruitfulness lasts all the
Night, till the Appearing of the Sun renders it barren, and causes all
the Flowers and Leaves to drop off, the Boughs remaining
wither&rsquo;d. On a sudden all that Fragrancy ceases, which
enrich&rsquo;d the Air with all the sweet Odours of <i>Asia</i>,
included in this alone; till the Sun leaving the Horizon again, the
Plant again flourishes in its beloved Darkness, as if it then
retriev&rsquo;d the Wrong it receiv&rsquo;d from the Light. The
<i>Asiaticks</i> are excessively fond of Perfumes, which is an Argument
of their Lasciviousness. Great Taxes are laid in several Provinces, on
all sweet Scents.</p>
<p>The <i>Portugueses</i> came arm&rsquo;d to that House, where the
aforesaid Princess <span class="marginnote">Portuguses <i>sent to
fetch</i> Aerio.</span> bred her Son, and demanded him in the Name of
<i>Tristan de Atayde</i>; she would willingly have hid him, but could
not, and therefore began to excuse her self, and beg they would leave
him. It avail&rsquo;d nothing, for the Messengers had Orders not to
return without him, and to gain her Consent, swore they would carry him
to reign in the stead of <i>Tabarija</i>, and that as soon as he came
to the Fort, he should be received as King, both by the <i>Ternates</i>
and <i>Portugueses</i>. Some Relations tell us, that then the Mother,
shedding Abundance of Tears, streightly embracing the Prince,
cry&rsquo;d out, saying, <i>Were I assur&rsquo;d that you took him away
to reign peaceably,</i> <span class="marginnote"><i>His Mother&rsquo;s
Speech to keep him.</i></span> <i>without any Opposition, or
Apprehension, well belov&rsquo;d and obey&rsquo;d by his Subjects, and
in settled Prosperity, undisturb&rsquo;d by any Frights; yet would I
rather see him grow up and continue in a private Life, without
burdening himself with any publick Concern, than that he should reign
to please your Humour; this was my Intention in retiring with him, and
I would gladly conceal him from all humane Conversation. If so, what
can I think of what you now promise me? Will it be reasonable, that I
deliver you my Son to receive the Crown, and that you at the same time
design him for Imprisonment and Fetters, from which nothing shall, or
can possible deliver him but Poison and false Accusations, which have
brought his Brothers and Parents to their End? What Security have I
from Fortune, that she will in this Child be reconciled to that Family,
which she has condemned to immortal Enmity with the</i> Europeans<i>,
in Requital for having friendly entertain&rsquo;d them; and decreed
that, instead of the Protection it hop&rsquo;d to find in your Arms,
you should lay on it an intollerable Yoke? Leave us then, both Mother
and Son, to employ our selves about the Works of Nature, since costly
Experience has so fully undeceived as to the Effects of Fortune. Permit
us to divert the Thoughts of them, with the Quiet, and Improvements of
these Gardens. Let us be allow&rsquo;d to want that which so many seek
after. James de Couto</i>, in his <i>Decades</i> relates this Fact, and
the Mother&rsquo;s Lamentation, and Words. The <i>Portugueses</i>, no
longer able to give Ear to those dismal Reflections, which did not
savour of a barbarous Woman, ran up to her, and forc&rsquo;d away her
Son, whom she struggled to defend. He, says the same Author, observing
his Mother&rsquo;s Tears, and the Reasons she alledg&rsquo;d for not
parting with him, and having some anticipated Notion of the Sweetness
of Reigning, which he had not yet tasted, stood gazing on her and them,
full of Confusion. The Rudeness, and Insolence <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>of the
Soldiers put an End to all; for tho&rsquo; they had no such Orders from
their Commander, being deaf to, and weary of hearing the Complaints of
<span class="marginnote"><i>The</i> Portuguese <i>murder
her</i>.</span> a Disconsolate Woman; they at the same time
seiz&rsquo;d the Son, and laying hold of the Mother, cast her headlong
out at the Window: The new King was carry&rsquo;d to the Fort, and at
the same time that the Subjects swore Fidelity to him, they with
general Lamentation celebrated his Mother&rsquo;s Obsequies, which were
perform&rsquo;d with greater Solemnity, than even those of the
Principal Queens. This Inhumanity exceeding even the <i>Canibals</i>,
and consequently unworthy the pretended <i>Portugueses</i> Bravery;
being bruited Abroad in the Neighbouring Provinces, produc&rsquo;d that
just Hatred which was of Force to unite; and actually drew into a
Confederacy all the Kings of the <i>Archipelago</i>, against the
<i>Portugueses</i>. They assembled <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Confederacy against them.</i></span> in Council, and in
the Meeting concerted their Design, declaring that the Oppression they
were under, was intollerable, the <i>Portugueses</i> making and
deposing Kings to <span class="corr" id="xd21e4060" title=
"Source: thier">their</span> own Humour and Fancy, insulting those
Crowns which had given them the Power they had abus&rsquo;d, contrary
to all Laws of Humanity, without allowing the Natives so much as a Vote
in Elections. Having agreed upon the Enterprize, they provided all
Things for the Execution, whilst the appointed Time came, which they
diligently made as short as might be, and expected with
Dissimulation.</p>
<p>The <i>Spanish</i> and <i>Portuguese</i> Fleets at this Time
continu&rsquo;d their Voyages to the <i>Archipelago</i>, their several
known Ways; the <i>Spaniards</i> from <i>New</i> <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Difference about the</i> Moluccos, <i>between</i> Spain
<i>and</i> Portugal.</span> <i>Spain</i> to the <i>Phillippine</i>
Islands; the <i>Portugueses</i> along the Coasts of <i>Africk</i>, and
so to <i>Malaca</i>. Both Sides exercised their Power, and
carry&rsquo;d on their Trade with Ambition, and, as some say, with
Cruelty; but the most bloody Theatre of continual Tragedies, was
<i>Ternate</i> and all the <i>Molucco</i>&rsquo;s. There both Nations
of <i>Castile</i> and <i>Portugal</i> decided their Quarrel by the
Sword, whilst their Kings in <i>Europe</i> only contended by Dint of
Cunning, and Cosmography. At this time the Matter was not so plain, as
when the Cosmographers and Commissioners on both Sides, lay&rsquo;d
down the Meridian, whereby to assign each of them one half of the World
to their King. For the Admiral <i>Christopher Columbus</i> returning
from his first Discovery of the <i>West-Indies</i>, in the Year
1493<span class="corr" id="xd21e4130" title="Source: .">,</span> Pope
<i>Alexander</i> the VIth. granted the Investiture of them, for the
Crown of <i>Castile</i>, to their Catholick Majesties, King
<i>Ferdinand</i>, and Queen <i>Isabel</i>, or <i>Elizabeth</i>; and to
obviate the Differences that might arise between the two Crowns, to the
obstructing the Propagation of the Gospel, by the same Apostolical
Authority, which in that spiritual Capacity is not limited to any part
of the Globe, he divided it betwixt those two Crowns, ordering a Line
to be drawn along the Heavens to cut both the Poles, distant on the
Earth one hundred Leagues from the Islands of the <i>Azores</i> and
<i>Cabo Verde</i>. By Vertue of this Division, the Emperor pretended
that the <i>Molucco</i> Islands were within his Limits, ever since
<i>Gonzalo Gomez de Espinosa</i>, his Commander in chief, <i>Sebastian
del Cano</i>, and his Companions, who went with <i>Magellan</i>, took
Possession of them for his Crown. Pretending at the same Time, that
they were the first Christians that arriv&rsquo;d at the
<i>Moluccos</i>, and that then he was own&rsquo;d as Sovereign by
<i>Sultan Corala</i>, King of <i>Ternate</i>, who reign&rsquo;d before
<i>Sultan Bongue</i>; by <i>Sultan Almanzor</i>, King of <i>Tydore</i>,
by <i>Luzuf</i>, King of <i>Gilolo</i>, and other Princes, who all
swore <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=
"pb31">31</a>]</span>Fealty by their Idols, and the <i>Alcoran</i>; and
that <i>Gonzalo Gomez</i> admitted them, and swore to the Observance of
what had been agreed on, in his <span class=
"marginnote"><i><span class="corr" id="xd21e4204" title=
"Source: Argments">Arguments</span> for</i> Spain.</span> King&rsquo;s
Name, before an Image of the Blessed Virgin. He urg&rsquo;d, that by
Mathematical Demonstration, and the Judgment of Men learned in that
Faculty, it appear&rsquo;d, that the <i>Moluccos</i> were within the
Limits of <i>Castile</i>, as were all others, as far as <i>Malaca</i>,
and even beyond it. That it was no easy Undertaking for <i>Portugal</i>
to go about to disprove the Writings of so many Cosmographers, and such
able Mariners; and particularly the Opinion of <i>Magellan</i>, who was
himself a <i>Portuguese</i>. And that in Case he might be thought
partial, because of his being disoblig&rsquo;d in <i>Portugal</i>, that
Exception did not lie against <i>Francis Serrano</i>, who was also a
<i>Portuguese</i>, and had been favour&rsquo;d and cherish&rsquo;d.
That to say the Sea Charts had been maliciously contriv&rsquo;d, was a
groundless Objection, and not probable. Besides that, in Relation to
the Article of Possession, on which the Controversy depended, it was
only requisite to stand by what was writ by, and receiv&rsquo;d among
Cosmographers.</p>
<p>In Answer to this, King <i>John</i> of <i>Portugal</i>, deny&rsquo;d
the Fact of the Discovery, <span class="marginnote">Portuguese
<i>Answer</i>.</span> as to its Precedency; for <i>Serrano</i>&rsquo;s
was in the Year 1511, and that of <i>Magellans</i> Companions nine
Years later, in 1520. He declar&rsquo;d the Globes, Astrolabes, and Sea
Charts to be partial, and that in Case they were rectify&rsquo;d,
drawing the aforesaid Meridian, according to Rules of Astrology, his
Limits would not only comprehend the <i>Moluccos</i>, but reach far
beyond the <i>Philippine</i> Islands. He offer&rsquo;d King
<i>Tabarija</i>&rsquo;s last Will on his Behalf; and said, that if the
Line were fairly drawn, observing Eclipses, as had been done sometimes,
the Truth of his Assertion would appear. To this they added, the Papers
of the Geographer and Astrologer, <i>Andrew de S. Martin</i>, by which
it appear&rsquo;d, that he sailing with <i>Magellan</i>, his before
unattempted Voyage, had observed several Eclipses, and Oppositions.
Among the rest, on the 17th of <i>December</i>, 1519. He in the River
call&rsquo;d <i>Rio de Janeyro</i>, took an Observation of a
Conjunction of <i>Jupiter</i> and the <i>Moon</i>; on the first of
<i>February</i> 1520, another of the <i>Moon</i> and <i>Venus</i>; soon
after another of the <i>Sun</i> and <i>Moon</i>, after passing the
Streights, another Opposition of the <i>Sun</i> and <i>Moon</i>, and
others at other times; all which, tho&rsquo; calculated by him to the
Meridian of <i>Sevil</i>, avail&rsquo;d nothing to his Design, which
was to prove that the <i>Molucco</i> Islands did not belong to
<i>Portugal</i>; for which Reason he found Fault with <i>John de
Monteregio&rsquo;s</i> Tables and Almanacks. All these Papers were
preserv&rsquo;d by <i>Edward Resende</i> Factor at the <i>Moluccos</i>,
a learned and curious Man. They said, that since there was then a
Treaty about the Possession of those Islands; in a Case of that
Consequence it was not proper, to avoid alledging, and examining the
Grounds of their Property, to prevent the Decision of the Sword, which
was the Court where that Controversy was pleaded; and when once it
comes to that pass, there was no Possibility of standing to speculative
Writing, which not being made good by Experience, must at least be
look&rsquo;d upon as uncertain.</p>
<p>The Possession of the <i>Molucco</i> Islands was of great
Consequence to the King of <i>Portugal</i>, for carrying on the Trade
of Spice, and being inform&rsquo;d of the War still maintain&rsquo;d
between his Subjects and the Emperor&rsquo;s, in those Parts, he daily
us&rsquo;d fresh Endeavours to bring that Business to some Conclusion,
that so the War might cease. The Emperor had not so <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span>much
Intelligence of what his Commanders did in <i>Asia</i>; because the
<i>Portuguese</i> suffer&rsquo;d no Ships, but their own to pass by the
Cape of <i>Good Hope</i>; and the way of <i>New-Spain</i>, that Voyage
was not much frequented, and therefore not so well known; and besides
all this he then stood in need of a great Sum of Money. In the Year
1525, there was a Treaty at <i>Segovia</i>, <span class=
"marginnote"><i>The Difference adjusted.</i></span> by his Majesties
Order, for composing of this Difference, and in 1526 it was held at
<i>Sevil</i>, where the <i>Portuguese</i> Embassador; and the
Licenciate <i>Azevedo</i> of that Kings Council, were met by the
Bishops of <i>Osma</i>, President of the Council of the <i>Indies</i>,
Doctor <i>Laurence Galindez</i>, of the same Council, and <i>Don Garcia
de Padilla</i>, first Commendary of <i>Calatrava</i>, on the
Emperor&rsquo;s side, as Commissioners, and Plenipotentaries, besides
the Lord-High-Chancellor, and the Popes <i>Nuncio</i>, <i>Mercurio
Gatnara</i>. After many Meetings, and much Strife, to which there were
also Civilians, Geographers, and Mariners admitted; all which only
puzzled the Cause, whence ensu&rsquo;d Law Suits, Arbitrations, and
other Fruitless Negociations in <i>Spain</i>, and Wars in <i>Asia</i>
between the Ships of both Crowns: After all this there was a Cessation,
and Quietness, the Emperor Mortgaging those controverted Islands to the
King of <i>Portugal</i>, for 350000 Ducats. This was concluded at
<i>Zaragoza</i>, on the 22d of <i>August</i> 1529, as his Imperial
Majesty was going over to be Crown&rsquo;d in <i>Italy</i>. The Line of
Division was again examin&rsquo;d, and what Parts of the Earth it is to
run through; the Times of Payment were fix&rsquo;d, with other
Conditions, and Salvos of the Right on both sides, that so neither
Oblivion, nor the Kindred between the two Kings might confound it.</p>
<p>By Relations Written in those Days it appears, that the Emperor
consulting <span class="marginnote">Spaniards <i>against quitting
the</i> Moluccos.</span> <i>Peter Ruyz de Villegas</i>, a grave and
learned Gentleman, about this Mortgage; his Answer was condemning it,
and declaring, That his Majesty had better to have Mortgaged any other
of his Kingdoms, than that of the <i>Moluccos</i>, <i>Trapobana</i>, or
<i>Malaca</i>, or any other in the East; all which, in his Opinion,
belong&rsquo;d to his Majesty; and the great uncertainty of State
Affairs. Many others advised the Emperor to repay that great Sum to the
King of <i>Portugal</i>; and what is yet more, the Representatives in
the <i>Cortes</i> of <i>Castile</i>, propos&rsquo;d that the Emperor
should make over to them the <i>Molucco</i> Islands for six Years, by
way of Farm, and they would pay King <i>John</i> the Mortgage Money,
and bring the Trade of Spice to <i>Coruna</i>, and after the six Years
his Majesty should carry on that Trade. The Emperor hearing of this
Innovation, order&rsquo;d a stop to it, and that no further Progress
should be made in fitting out the Fleet design&rsquo;d for the
<i>Moluccos</i>, under <i>Simon de Alcazova</i>, and forwarded by the
Bishop of <i>Ciudad Rodrigo</i>.</p>
<p>Orders, and Letters Patents, were drawn and sealed, for both Nations
to forbear Hostilities, but the Emperor&rsquo;s Subjects never
receiv&rsquo;d Commands from him to withdraw their Forces for any other
Enterprize, nor did they <span class="marginnote"><i>War ceases
between</i> Spaniards <i>and</i> Portugueses.</span> know what had been
agreed on in <i>Spain</i>, any other way than by the Account they had
from the <i>Portugueses</i> who had receiv&rsquo;d Orders from their
King, to conclude a Peace, and to Ship off the <i>Spaniards</i> by the
way of <i>India</i> for <i>Spain</i>. This Agreement put an End to all
Judicial, and Military Contention. Since then the Vicissitude of Times
has invested all the Right, and Title in our King. So that, according
to grave Civilians, he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33"
name="pb33">33</a>]</span>might, as they say, invert the Titles, or
possess by them all, without confounding the Right; Heaven having
design&rsquo;d him to be Sovereign of such a vast Monarchy, and given
him that Hereditary Zeal, which makes him offer his whole Power to
oppose Hereticks and Sectaries, and to spread the Faith, and its
perfect Politicks among such Multitudes of Souls as have received it,
in so many barbarous Provinces. For this same Reason it will be
superfluous to examine any further into the Limits assign&rsquo;d by
that Law, which could never be settled.</p>
<p>This Accommodation being concluded, the <i>Portuguese</i> Fleets,
without <span class="marginnote">Portugueses <i>Possession of the</i>
Moluccos.</span> any Opposition from those of <i>Castile</i>, peaceably
possess&rsquo;d themselves of the Islands of <i>Ternate</i>,
<i>Tydore</i>, <i>Bachian</i>, and the others about them. From the
first of these, as their Head in Spirituals, our Priests went Abroad to
preach the Word of Truth, which was receiv&rsquo;d by several Kings and
Nations, leaving but inconsiderable Remains of Idolatry, and other
Sects. Whole Cities, whose Soveraigns chose to continue in their
Darkness, not regarding their Prince&rsquo;s Example, which uses to
have the Force of a Law, threw down their Idols, and consecrated
Profaneness, dedicating their Temples to the True God. The Kings of
<i>Portugal</i> built Garrisons, and Factories for the Christians to
inhabit; sending their Commanders and Officers, who curbed the Kings,
and the <i>Sangiacks</i> their Subjects. Some Governours there were,
who besides the Care they took of propagating <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Conversions.</i></span> the Gospel, and maintaining
Peace in those Parts, endeavour&rsquo;d by endearing Means to attract
the Barbarians to love our Habits, to affect our Ways of Entertainment,
and the <i>European</i> Affability and Conversation, and gently
inclin&rsquo;d them to our Customs and Manners, which in some Places
made them look upon that as a Sort of Equality, when it was no better
than Servitude. The powerful Union of Justice and Religion was however
the most prevalent; but the Commanders and Governours being defective
in the first of these Virtues, on which inward Felicity and Government
depend; the Subjects lost the second, and return&rsquo;d to their
former Blindness, as appears by what has been already said, and more
fully by what is to follow, since we are now come to the Election of
<i>Sultan Aerio</i>, in whose Days <i>Ternate</i> was utterly lost, and
could never be recovered either by Force or Art, till the Reign of our
Sovereign Lord the King; a just Reward of his Piety and Zeal. The
lawful Queen, by those People call&rsquo;d <i>Putriz</i>, was as much
concern&rsquo;d for <i>Aerio</i>&rsquo;s Mother&rsquo;s Death, as for
any of her own Sons. She was present at her Funeral, and lamenting
immoderately, curs&rsquo;d the Domination of the <i>Portugueses</i>,
calling it Tyranny. All the Machinations of those who study&rsquo;d
Revenge were known to her, and she forwarded them with her Advice; for
as they said, nothing now remain&rsquo;d of the former Moderation of
the Governours sent thither out of <i>Europe</i>, nor of that Regard
and Respect they used to have for them.</p>

<p class="first">The Alliance concluded betwixt the Kings of the
<i>Archipelago</i>, and particularly <i>Vaygamano</i>, <i>Vaigeo</i>,
<i>Quibibio</i>, and <i>Mincimbio</i>, reigning in the Islands
<i>Papuas</i>, was follow&rsquo;d by such an Accident, that tho&rsquo;
the Minds of the Confederates had not been already so well
dispos&rsquo;d, nor the Blood of those Innocent Kings so newly spilt,
it would have consummated the Hatred they had conceived against the
<i>Portuguese</i> Nation. All the Ports of the <i>Molucco</i> Islands
were so well secur&rsquo;d, and the Passage for Provisions so wholly
stopp&rsquo;d up, that <i>Tristan de Atayde</i> despairing of Relief,
sent Captain <i>Pinto</i> to <i>Mindanao</i>, <span class=
"marginnote">Pinto <i>sent for Relief.</i></span> and the Neighbouring
Islands, to furnish such things as were absolutly necessary for the
Support of Life, there being nothing to be had within his Liberties.
<i>Pinto</i> sailing in a good Ship, arriv&rsquo;d at <i>Mindanao</i>,
visited the King, by whom he was well receiv&rsquo;d; and he having
seen his Credentials, and consulted the <i>Sangiacks</i> of his
Council, establish&rsquo;d Peace and Amity with him. He sold the
Commodities he carry&rsquo;d at his own Rates, and buying and
barterring, loaded with Provisions to his own Content; thence he went
over to the Island <i>Seriago</i>, where he was no less successful with
the King. In this Island, that their Friendship might last for ever,
they concluded the Peace with a barbarous Ceremony, which when
practis&rsquo;d in those Parts, they never break the Articles. The
Parties being met, certain Officers appointed for that Purpose, draw a
Quantity of Blood from <span class="marginnote"><i>Barbarous
Custome.</i></span> their Arms, and each drinks the other&rsquo;s, as a
Gage of Affection; believing they convey it into their Souls, by that
horrid Draught. This Contract so ratify&rsquo;d, produc&rsquo;d such
Confidence, that their Ships repair&rsquo;d to our <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>Ports,
and ours to theirs, with all possible Security, without any Let or
Prohibition. <i>Pinto</i> perceiving what a Multitude of the Natives
resorted to his Ship, resolved to make a Prey of them; and the last
Day, Forty of them coming Aboard to Trade, he perswaded them to go down
into the Hold, on Pretence of showing them its Bulk and Conveniencies,
and as <span class="marginnote"><i>Villany of</i> Pinto.</span> soon as
they were down, shut the Hatches upon them; this he practised several
times, till at last, tho&rsquo; he observ&rsquo;d them close, one of
them forcing his Way out, leap&rsquo;d into the Sea, and swam ashore.
He went directly to the King, whom he acquainted with the villanous
Practice; The King justly enrag&rsquo;d, to see Friendship so newly
contracted, and confirm&rsquo;d by the most sacred of Tyes, in his
Opinion, so perfidiously violated by the <i>Portugueses</i>, thinking
Religion affronted, immediately order&rsquo;d all the Ships that were
afloat to be brought together, and such as were finish&rsquo;d in the
Docks, to be launch&rsquo;d; all which being well equipp&rsquo;d,
stor&rsquo;d with Guns, and full of those furious Barbarians,
encompass&rsquo;d the <i>Portuguese</i> Ship, attacking her on all
Sides. <i>Pinto</i> was beginning to weigh his Anchors, having seen the
Ships in Motion, and the Men hasting Aboard; he defended himself with
only 25 Soldiers, who had scarce time to handle their Arms; for the
Natives of <i>Seriago</i> began already to Board, and those who were
Prisoners under Deck had prevaild, but that the Mariners loos&rsquo;d
their Sails. At this time there fell a dreadful Storm of Rain, with
such amazing Thunder and Lightning, as if the Heavens had been rent
asunder. The <i>Seriagos</i> quitted the <i>Portuguese</i> Ship,
endeavouring to recover the Shore in their own Vessels, with their
Sails rent, the Hulls shatter&rsquo;d, and the Rigging disabled; and to
get off the better, they threw over-board their Cannon and Arms, being
in danger of sinking. This Tempest lasted two Days, during which Time,
<i>Pinto</i>&rsquo;s Ship could not escape, his Men and he being so far
spent, that they had neither Strength nor Courage to stand by their
Tackle; they let the Ship drive with the Sea, and threw over-board
their Provisions, Merchandize, Guns, Arms, Cloaths, and all they could
come at; and being convinc&rsquo;d of the Justice of the Judgment, for
having broken their Faith, and solemn Engagement they had made,
arriv&rsquo;d at <i>Ternate</i> astonish&rsquo;d, dumb, and out of
Countenance, thinking they were still in the Storm. Such are the
Effects of a guilty Conscience, which presently provokes God&rsquo;s
Wrath.</p>
<p>All the Kings of the adjacent Islands were soon acquainted with the
<span class="marginnote"><i>Leagues against the</i> Portugueses.</span>
Perfidiousness of those few <i>Portugueses</i>, that they had
transgress&rsquo;d the sacred Laws of Hospitality, and always made a
mischievous Use of Benefits; whereupon they immediately concluded their
League, to be exercised like desperate Men. They presently made
Proclamation, forbidding, under most severe Penalties, the conveying of
any Provisions to the <i>Portugueses</i>, either by Sea or Land, that
so they might be reduc&rsquo;d to quit all those Provinces, and fly
into <i>India</i>, and since they could not batter the Fort, for Want
of great Guns, they should starve it out; enjoyning all Persons of all
Ages, and both Sexes, to be vigilant in observing this fatal Decree,
that so the Trading Galeon might not afford them the Comfort of hoping
for Relief. Then considering that the main Motive of their exercising
such Tyranny, was the Spice of Cloves, wherewith <i>Ternate</i>, and
all the <i><span class="corr" id="xd21e4692" title=
"Source: Molluccos">Moluccos</span></i> abound, the Natives
resolv&rsquo;d to set Fire to all the Trees, endeavouring <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>that the
Conflagration should be so Universal, as that the <i>Moluccos</i> might
ever after remain barren. They well knew that this was contriving their
own Ruin; but they look&rsquo;d upon it as a pleasing and advantageous
Destruction, so they might but be reveng&rsquo;d of their Enemies.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Reflection.</i></span> The Crop of
Cloves makes the Wealth of the <i>Molucco</i> Kings, much more than the
Taxes their Subjects pay; and tho&rsquo; Rage, and Despair put Fire
into their Hands, to burn their Country, it might happen, as sometimes
Mistakes prove advantageous, that what they design&rsquo;d to render
their Fields Barren, might make them more Fruitful. It is well known
that course Ashes mix&rsquo;d, and scatter&rsquo;d on the Face of the
Earth often Fertilize it. Nothing is more frequent in <i>Europe</i>
than to burn the Stubble, and Straw upon barren Lands; because, either
the burnt Earth gathers some Unknown Strength, and produces good
Pasture, or else the Fire consumes its Rankness, and exhales the
superfluous Moisture. Perhaps the intense Heat opens several Passages,
and dilates the close Pores, and hidden Veins, thro&rsquo; which the
Nourishment flows, and thence the Earth receives it in all Parts, to
make it capable of a new Product; or else it hardens, and closes the
Vents which were open&rsquo;d, that so the thin Waters, or the
continual Intenseness of the Sun, or the piercing Cold of the
North-East Wind, which is chilling, may do it no Harm. Besides, Nature
having chosen that only Part of the World to produce this sort of
Fruit, in which there has never been observ&rsquo;d any Failure, or
Intermission, it could not be believing that a Momentary Violence
should utterly cause it to cease. However the Design of those People
was not to renew those Spicy Groves, but entirely to destroy them. This
shows how mischievously they were bent against themselves, and against
all Nations. It will be therefore convenient in this Place to treat of
the Cloves at large.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Account of Cloves.</i></span> The first
that made any Account of it, were the <i>Chineses</i>, who attracted by
the Scent, began to load their <i>Junks</i> with it for the Gulphs of
<i>Persia</i> and <i>Arabia</i>. <i>Pliny</i> was acquainted with, and
defines it, saying, It is a long Pepper; and calls it
<i>Garyophillum</i>. The <i>Persians</i> gave it since the Name of
<i>Calafur</i>, it does not belong to us to decide which of these Words
was derived from the other. The <i>Spaniards</i> formerly call&rsquo;d
it <i>Girofe</i>, and afterwards <i>Clavos</i>, because they are like
Nails, which bear the same Name. The Head of the Clove, having four
small Teeth that cross it, resembles a Star. The Natives of the
<i>Moluccos</i> call the Tree <i>Siger</i>, the Leaf <i>Varaqua</i>,
and the Fruit <i>Chamque</i>. The Plant is not unlike our Bay-Tree, but
bears a greater Head. When it begins to blossom, it spreads a most
delicious Fragrancy, and on the very Top like the Myrtle, from one
single Stock produces an infinite Number of Clusters, like those of
<i>Elder</i>, or the <i>Honey-Suckle</i>. At first coming out they are
White, as they grow up Green, and the third Season, when Ripe, makes
them Red; this Variety of Colours, by inward Virtue, showing the
several Terms that bring it to Perfection. Those that remain on the
Clusters, which they call <i>Mother Cloves</i>, continue there a year,
growing larger and stronger. They either thresh the Branches to gather
them, or else shake them with Cords they have made fast above, drawing
from below, after the Ground about is clean&rsquo;d; but it is
naturally clear from Weeds, for this Sovereign Tree suffers no sort of
Herb to grow about it. It draws all the moisture so powerfully to it
self, that all <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name=
"pb37">37</a>]</span>Roots about are destroy&rsquo;d, or starv&rsquo;d.
It bears at eight Years standing, and lasts an hundred. Some say it
would hold longer, were it not strip&rsquo;d with such Violence, which
it avenges by growing Barren; but they are mistaken, for in the Islands
of <i>Bachian</i>, they lop the Branches, that they may produce more
Cloves, and the low Branches bear least. From these they gather the
Cloves with their Hands, and they only bear when the <i>Monson</i>
blows. They yield their Fruit from <i>September</i> to <i>February</i>
every two Years. Others say once in three; because when they gather the
Clove, besides that the Plant is much impair&rsquo;d, they break off
those Buds, which produce the Blossoms of the Cloves; but then they
afford certain hopes of another Crop. The Truth of it is, that Nature
allows them a Year&rsquo;s respit, during which they rest like the
Olive-Trees in <i>Europe</i>. They are gathered when Ripe, and their
Ripeness appears by being Red. Being spread in the Sun, in three Days
they dry up, and contract a blackish Ash-colour. <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Mistake of</i> Avicen.</span></p>
<p><i>Avicen</i>, by his leave, was deceiv&rsquo;d, when he said that
the Gum of the Clove Tree is answerable in its Virtue to Turpentine;
for Experience has prov&rsquo;d the contrary. Besides, that Trees
excessive hot or cold, <span class="corr" id="xd21e4800" title=
"Source: yeild">yield</span> no Gum, but only those which are temperate
between both. Sea-Water Feeds, and Fresh does them Harm. A certain
Historian Writes, that they yield Fruit twice a Year; if by it he means
the middle Crop, which is very small, we grant it; but if he speaks of
the most Fruitful, as the Triennial, which with general Amazement
produces enough to serve all Nations, the Belief of his Assertion will
remain in the Author himself. These Plants make amends for their delay
in the Abundance of their Product; which is such, that after enriching
all Nations with it, the K. of <i>Spain</i>&rsquo;s Revenue out of it,
Yearly amounts to two Millions of pieces of Eight, little over or
under. It is generally reckon&rsquo;d that only the five <i>Molucco</i>
Islands produce all the Clove, because of the prodigious Quantity they
yield. They always amount to Four Thousand <i>Bars</i>, each Bar of
<i>Ternate</i> being four hundred Weight, and three quarters, and this
for that Island; but the third of the whole taken for the King amounts
to six thousand Bars, and every common Bar is better than five hundred
Weight of ours. Perhaps the Word <i>Bar</i> might come from the
<i>Greek Baros</i>, signifying a Load. The Cloves grow also in the
small Islands of <i>Ires</i> and <i>Meytarana</i>, about
<i>Ternate</i>; those of <i>Pulo</i> and <i>Cavali</i> near
<i>Tydore</i>, and in <i>Gilolo</i>, <i>Sabugo</i> and
<i>Gamoconora</i>, Towns of <i>Barachina</i>; as also in the Islands of
<i>Amboyna</i> and <i>Veranula</i>, more in this last than in all the
others, but they are weak, and smaller. The Clove Trees grow up without
any Help or Art, like all Trees coming from Rocks, and they made the
only Woods in these Islands, which sucking in all the moisture Heaven
affords, it is a wonder to see any other Plant near. When they have a
mind to Transplant a Clove Tree, they set it where many Weeds grow,
that it may thrive the sooner, by the help of the Moisture, and Virtue
it sucks from them, and as the Tree thrives those Plants perish. For
the same reason Cloves are ill Neighbours to full Vessels. The Ring
Doves, whereof there are great numbers in <i>Gilolo</i>, eat many of
those Cloves which grow Old upon the Tree, then flying they purge in
the Air with the Motion, and from their Excrements dropping on the
Ground Clove Trees grow up. Heaven has given them so <span class="corr"
id="xd21e4863" title="Source: plentfully">plentifully</span> only to
these Islands, abstractly from all the World beside; being at first not
valu&rsquo;d, or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span>known by the Natives. This is what they would have
destroy&rsquo;d by Fire, that it might be totally annihilated; because
the Flames gather more Strength among combustible Matter, than other
Violences, to which sublunary things are subject.</p>
<p>Since we are now upon the Description of the <i>Moluccos</i>, and in
regard <span class="marginnote">Moluccos <i>describ&rsquo;d</i>.</span>
that those delightful Provinces are so remote from us, we will go on
with what is remarkable in them, to show the desperate Fury of those
People, who had condemn&rsquo;d them to the Flames. All the five
<i>Molucco</i> Islands are almost round, and of the same Shape. The
compass of the biggest is not seven Leagues. They have all Crags, of a
wonderful Height, cover&rsquo;d with an odoriferous Fragrancy of wild
Cloves; and about them several Cities, Towns and Forts. Their exact
Roundness is the Reason they have no good Harbours for both the
<i>Monsons</i> of Norwest and South. Only <i>Ternate</i> forms the Port
they call <i>Talangame</i>, and a League from it, that of
<i>Toloco</i>, where Ships ride safe, and with their Boats close to the
Shore. The Forts were not erected in either of them, because they
should not be remote from the King&rsquo;s Court. Both these Ports look
to the Eastward, and have ridges of Rocks that break off the Sea, and
secure the Vessels. That of <i>Ternate</i>, opposite to the Fort admits
of Caravels, at high Water and spring-Tides, which being unloaded ride
where they will. This Ridge of Rocks is of a sort of Stone, that turns
into Coral, which when old hardens, and shooting out many Branches,
knits together, and turns again into Stone, whereof excellent Lime is
made. It is so contriv&rsquo;d that those who come to it by Sea, think
they see noble Structures erected for the Defence of the Harbour. The
Mountain, which rises in the midst of <i>Ternate</i>, two <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Burning Mountain.</i></span> Leagues in Height, and
cover&rsquo;d with Palm, and other rare Trees, has on the Top of it a
Mouth or Cave, that seems to reach down to the very Center. A Man can
hardly be seen from the one side to the other. Within it is a Square
Spot, like a Threshing-Floor, made of Stones and loose Earth. Some
curious Persons have view&rsquo;d it, and among them one <i>Gabriel
Rebelo</i> Factor, and Alcayde of the Fort; who having sounded it,
tying together several long Fishing-Lines, found it was 500 Fath. deep.
At the Bottom gushes out a beautiful Spring, tho&rsquo; no Man has
dar&rsquo;d to Tast of it, or try whether it is Sweet or Sower. The
loose Floor shakes with the Fire in the Bowels of the Mountain; whereof
the first Account was given by <i>Anthony Galvam</i>, who
Observ&rsquo;d it in the Year 1538, when he was Commander in Chief over
these Islands. He went up to see that Wonder in Nature, at a safe Time,
for he could not have done it in <i>April</i>, or <i>September</i>,
when the Sun moves from one Hemisphere to the other, and crosses the
Equinoctial, which cuts half a Degree of <i>Ternate</i>, because of the
Winds then kindling the Flames. Had <i>Pliny</i>, when he went out of
Curiosity to see the Burning of Mount <i>Vesuvius</i>, in <i>Italy</i>,
taken another opportunity, he had not been Burnt to Death, as his
Nephew writ to <i>Cornelius Tacitus</i>. It stinks, and casts out
Smoke, Sulphur, and Red-Stones, as it were out of the Mouth of a Canon;
shewing the Mountain to be hollow at the Foundation. It causes
Earthquakes, and Noise; and the Flames, and burnt Stones, have
reach&rsquo;d to the City, and Fort, and even to the Islands of the
<i>Meaos</i> and <i>Casures</i>, twenty Leagues from <i>Ternate</i>.
The Smoke is of several Colours, because the Moisture and Corruption of
the Earth exhales it thick, and diversify&rsquo;d, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name="pb39">39</a>]</span>which is
help&rsquo;d by the ill Quality of the Air, and that, with the falling
of the Excrements the Fire casts out upon the Springs, corrupts the
Waters, and destroys Health. Going up this Mountain two thirds of the
Height, it is all Green and Fruitful; but the Top is excessive Cold,
without any sort of Fowl, or Birds, but abundance of Flyes. Thence is
descry&rsquo;d a spacious Sea, and an infinite Number of Islands;
because the Purity of the Air, free from Exhalations, as is said of the
Top of Mount <i>Olympus</i>, represents curious Objects to the Sight,
and favours it without any Let, the greater part of the Year. Where the
Thickness of the Trees Terminates, a Spring of fresh Water gushes out,
so very cold that there is no Drinking of it, but by Sips. At the Top,
some distance from the Mouth, which casts out the Flames, they at this
time tore away a piece of the Mountain, whence for two Days abundance
of Water flow&rsquo;d; great pieces of Rocks roul&rsquo;d down the side
of the Hill, to the Sea; forming Concavities, and bearing down Trees,
and Ruins. The same Mountain, on the Top, has a spacious sweet Pool,
encompass&rsquo;d with Trees, wherein there are blew, and gold-Colour
Alligators, above a Fadom long, who, as soon as they hear People
stirring, plunge down to the Bottom.</p>
<p>These Islands know no Difference of Summer and Winter; nor is there
<span class="marginnote"><i>Seasons.</i></span> any settled Rainy
Season, but it generally Rains more with the North-East, than with the
South Wind. The <i>Molucco</i> Islands breed Snakes above 30
<span class="marginnote"><i>Snakes.</i></span> Foot long, and
proportionably thick; but they are neither Quick of Motion, nor
Venomous. Those who have seen them affirm, That when they want
Sustenance, they chew a certain Herb Nature has shown them, and
climbing the Trees by the Sea-side, cast into it what they have
chew&rsquo;d; many Fishes come to Eate it, and being made Drunk, lye
helpless upon the Water; then the Snakes launch out upon them, and
satisfy their Hunger, till they are full of those stupify&rsquo;d
Fishes. The Crocodils on the Land are <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Crocodils.</i></span> the fiercest of Monsters; the
Ancients write almost the contrary of those of the <i>Nile</i>. These
in the Sea are so Timorous, that they suffer themselves to be bound
under Water. A Crocodile has been taken that had four Eyes, and a very
little Heart. Here are also found certain Insects, which they
<span class="marginnote"><i>Insect.</i></span> call <i>Cuzos</i>,
living on Trees, on whose Fruit they feed: They are like Rabbits, their
Hair thick, harsh, and curl&rsquo;d, of a brightish Brown; their Eyes
round and sprightly; their Feet small; and a very long Tail, by which
they hang, the better to reach the Fruit; and they stink like
Foxes.</p>
<p>In the Desert Parts there are Wild-Fowl; some of the Tame are the
same we have in <i>Europe</i>. The Parots, in their Tongue call&rsquo;d
<i>Nores</i>, of several <span class="marginnote"><i>Parots.</i></span>
Colours intermixt, Cry excessively, but Talk well. An Islander affirms,
That at this time, when the People were Conspiring, a Parrot in the Air
cry&rsquo;d, <i>I Dye, I Die</i>; and beating his Wings, fell down
Dead. A Relation tells us of another, that came from <i>Amboyna</i>, on
the Mast of a small Vessel, when they went to take him, he cry&rsquo;d
out, <i>Sebastian, Sebastian</i>, who was his Master, and came to his
assistance. There are great flocks of <span class=
"marginnote"><i><span class="corr" id="xd21e5001" title=
"Source: Brids">Birds</span> and Fishes.</i></span> black Geese, with
Parrots Feet; Martins, Swallows, Feldefares, Thrushes, and
Sparrow-Hawks. The variety of Fish is infinite; the Sea-Cow, like that
of <i>Brazil</i>; a sort of Crab, one part whereof Eaten, kills in 24
Hours; this is on the Sea-shore, under certain Trees, whose shade
suffers no Grass or Herb to grow; those who Sleep in it Sicken, and it
dries and parches up <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40"
name="pb40">40</a>]</span>the very Ground. There is another sort of
Crabs, <span class="corr" id="xd21e5010" title="Source: no">not</span>
unlike Lobsters, but with less Claws; they have strong white Teeth,
with which they break the Shels, to eat the Almonds; they breed among
Rocks, are taken at Night with Light; their Body, Claws, and all the
Flesh, is like that of a Lobster. Near the Tail they have a Bag, full
of a certain Substance delicious to the Tast, for which they are as
much valu&rsquo;d as Pullets.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Strange Sticks.</i></span> All over the
<i>Moluccos</i> there grows a sort of reddish Sticks, which burn in the
Fire, raise a Flame, and are like a burning Cole, without wasting; They
look to be of a Stony Nature, moulder away betwixt the Fingers, and are
easily broken by the Teeth. Not far from the Fort of <i>Ternate</i>, is
to <span class="marginnote"><i>Tree of Butter-Flies.</i></span> be seen
the Plant call&rsquo;d <i>Catopa</i>, from which there drop Leaves less
than the common sort; the Stem whereof, on a sudden, is form&rsquo;d
into the Head of a Worm, or Butter-Fly; the Body and Fibers coming from
it, make Feet, and the Leafy Part, Wings; so that it soon becoms a
perfect Butter-Fly, and at the same time a Leaf. This Tree buds out
every Year, like a Chestnut-Tree, and from the Buds proceed these
Worms, which run upon Threads fastened to the Leaves. Nature was
profuse with those People; especially as to the Cloves, which I
distinguish from the Long-Peper <i>Pliny</i> perhaps spoke of, when he
nam&rsquo;d the <i>Garyophillum</i>. But since the Profit of that so
highly valu&rsquo;d Product, was to occasion such bloody Wars, such
incredible Voiages, from all Parts of the World, that the real Dangers,
are even beyond human Belief; it may well be controverted, whether it
were <span class="marginnote"><i>A good Remark.</i></span> most for the
publick Tranquility, that this Spice should be known, or ever
conceal&rsquo;d; for its Plenty and Virtue, which awaken&rsquo;d the
Avarice of the remotest Nations, has glutted those Seas with the Wracks
of Ships, and Fleets, and call&rsquo;d thither Armies of Rebels, making
their passage through Streights before unknown, in the Sight of
Mountains cover&rsquo;d with blew Ice and Snow, as never reach&rsquo;d
by the Suns bright Beams; and yet they venture at all, not out of any
Zeal of promoting Religion, or Civility, but only to load with that
Spice, which has occasion&rsquo;d Disobedience and Superstition. This
is the precious Commodity, which gives Power and Wealth to those Kings,
and causes their Wars. A Wonder of Nature, which plainly shows it has
created nothing so harmless, but what is abus&rsquo;d by human Malice.
This is the true Fruit of Discord, rather than the fabulous Apple of
the three Godesses, since for it there has been, and still is, more
Fighting, than for the Mines of Gold. Had this happen&rsquo;d in the
Days of the <i>Greek</i>, or <i>Latin</i> Poets, how much more would
thay have spoken of our <i>Moluccos</i>, than they did of the Islands
<i>Gorgones</i> in the <i>Ethiopick</i> Ocean? Let us stop a little to
reflect on the Dangers Mortals expose themselves to, rather, perhaps,
to please their wanton Appetites, than to confirm their Health.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Confederates meet.</i></span> The
People of <i>Ternate</i>, <i>Tydore</i>, <i>Bachian</i>, and all the
Neighbouring Princes, being impatient to put in Execution their
desperate Design, chose the King of <i>Tydore</i> for their Head, to
joyn with him of <i>Ternate</i>, that had been expell&rsquo;d on
account of the Death of <i>Gonzalo Pereyra</i>. Among the Relations
usually collected by the Christian Curiosity of the Religious Men of
the Society, we find that these Kings met in the little Island, which
divides <i>Ternate</i> from <i>Tydore</i>, before they went each of
them to his proper Post for performing what was stipulated in the
Confederacy, and there the King of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41"
href="#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span><i>Tydore,</i> as Chief of the
League, spoke to them in this Manner. <i>I cannot mention the Occasion
of this our Union, without shedding Tears, for the Joy <span class=
"marginnote"><i>King of</i> Tydore<i>&rsquo;s Speech</i>.</span> of the
Success, which we look upon as present, produces the same Effects it
would do, were we already Victorious. Our Forces are assembled to
deliver us from the</i> Spanish <i>Yoke, punishing those Men with the
Hazard of our Total Ruin, whom neither our Benefits could oblige, nor
our Threats correct. They are the great Robbers of the World, who usurp
it, by shrowding their Avarice under specious and godly Pretences. In
vain have we endeavour&rsquo;d to moderate their Pride by Means of our
Modesty and Submission. If they meet with Wealthy Enemies, the</i>
Portugeses <i>show <span class="corr" id="xd21e5110" title=
"Source: themseives">themselves</span> Covetous, if with Needy, they
are Ambitious; this is the only Nation that equally seeks after others
Wealth and Miseries. They rob, kill, and subdue, taking away our
Dominions under false Titles, and think they have no settled Peace,
till they have reduc&rsquo;d the Provinces into Desarts. We possess the
most fruitful Islands in</i> Asia<i>, only to purchase Servitude and
base Subjection with their Product, converting this blessed Bounty of
Heaven into Tribute paid to the Ambition of Intruding Tyrants.
Experience has show&rsquo;d us, how odious our Valour has been to the
Christian Commanders, whom, for the same Reason, we must never hope to
find more modest, or less our Enemies. Assure your selves then, and
remember, both Kings and Subjects, both you who seek Glory, and you who
provide for your Safety, that neither of these is to be had without
Liberty, nor this without War; nor is the War to be maintain&rsquo;d
without Courage and Unanimity. The Power of the</i> Portugueses <i>is
increased, and on it their Reputation depends. Having then
discover&rsquo;d the Mystery, and Cause of this Tyranny, who is there
that will not prepare to try the utmost of Fortune, to purchase the
greatest of human Felicities, which is Liberty. Other Nations, which
when they hear of our Resolution, will call it Despair and Savageness;
if they weigh it with the Occasion, will rather Commend than go about
to find Excuses for us. Besides, every Man knows what is fit for his
Religion, his Honour and his Country, better than those who judge of
these Things at a Distance. In short, What is Life worth without
Liberty?</i></p>
<p>Those incensed Kings made suitable Returns to these Words, and
having taken proper Measures to commence and carry on the War, went
away in their Vessels, without losing Time, or admitting of Delay; as
well knowing the many Dangers a great Undertaking is expos&rsquo;d to,
which depends on Secrecy, and is imparted to many.</p>
<p>On the Day appointed, all the Natives departed the City of
<i>Ternate</i>, <span class="marginnote">Ternate <i>City
abandon&rsquo;d and burnt</i>.</span> with their Families, not in good
Order, as in Transmigrations, but raging, in Confusion, and loaded with
their Children, and a few Necessaries, having before sent away their
Effects to other Islands. To convince the <i>Portugueses</i> of their
Design, and that the People of <i>Ternate</i> abandon&rsquo;d the
Country, they set Fire to the City in several Places; the Flames began
to take hold and spread, till they met, and of many small ones became
one general Conflagration, with hideous Noise and Cries; for not only
the Houses were burnt, which had for so many Ages belong&rsquo;d to
their Forefather, and Ancestors, but all that attracts the Affection to
our Native Country, the Temples, all their worldly Treasure, and the
Bounty of Nature; for the open Country began now to feel the
Desolation, the Caves, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42"
name="pb42">42</a>]</span>Lakes and Springs, the Rocks, and the very
Sea it self shin&rsquo;d, boil&rsquo;d up and crack&rsquo;d, and the
Fire receiv&rsquo;d into the subterraneous Caverns, lying in the hollow
Mountains, pierced into the deepest Recesses, roaring and overturning
Stones and Trees. In the mean while, the People travell&rsquo;d towards
the Desarts, looking back to view the Effects of their Revenge.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Resolution of the People.</i></span>
<i>Tristan de Atayde</i>, amaz&rsquo;d to behold that dreadful
Practice, having arm&rsquo;d some Soldiers, sent Messages to The Queen
and Governours, to propose some Accommodation, and appease that
inhumane Rage. He promis&rsquo;d to make Satisfaction, and that all
Things should be set right, but it avail&rsquo;d nothing; for they
rather grew more furious, and would not hearken to any Proposal, or
admit of Treaty, that might make them slacken in their Resolution.
Being come to those Places which Nature has made strong among the
Rocks, they arm&rsquo;d, and in Parties fell upon the Christians, lying
in wait for them when they went out for Wood or Water, and killing or
wounding them by Surprize. The Edict was put in Execution throughout
all the Islands at the same Time, destroying all the <i>Portugueses</i>
that were in them. In the City <i>Momoya</i>, they kill&rsquo;d eight
that were with <i>F.</i> <span class="marginnote">Portugueses
<i>slaughter&rsquo;d</i>.</span> <i>Francis Alvarez</i>, but he fled to
a Ship, after receiving several Wounds. In the Island of <i>Chion</i>,
the Head of <i>Moratay</i>; they also slew the Priest, <i>Simon
Vaz</i>; an Infidel rushing into his Chamber, broke in Pieces the
Picture of the Blessed Virgin, he found there painted on a Board; but
Heaven suffer&rsquo;d him not to go unpunish&rsquo;d, for his Hands
drop&rsquo;d off on the Spot, and he dy&rsquo;d a few Days after. It
was further observ&rsquo;d, that within a Year there was not one left
alive of all his Race, which was destroy&rsquo;d in War, and by other
Misfortunes and Calamities; as the last of them was fishing, a Needle
Fish sprung out of the Water, and struck him with the Snout in the Eye,
whereof he dyed. The whole Town perished miserably within a few Years.
<i>Tristan de Atayde</i> soon receiv&rsquo;d the News of this Slaughter
of the <i>Portugueses</i>, and so successively of the others,
throughout all the Islands. He encourag&rsquo;d his Men, and
labour&rsquo;d to hide his Concern for being shut up among so many
Enemies; he regulated the Distribution of Provisions; sent out several
Spies, to get Information of the Enemies Motions and Designs: and
order&rsquo;d the Guard upon King <i>Aerio</i>, who was in the Fort, to
be always watchful, for the more Security, leaving only the Nurses, and
other Women that attended him. Then he again employ&rsquo;d other
Persons to propose a Peace to the Queen, and the King of <i>Tydore</i>,
with ample Commission to offer advantageous Conditions, which were to
be immediately perform&rsquo;d; but all prov&rsquo;d ineffectual, for
an Accident which soon happen&rsquo;d confirm&rsquo;d the Enemies
Obstinacy.</p>
<p><i>Catabruno</i>, Governour of <i>Gilolo</i>, and Tutor to the
Infant King, finding <span class="marginnote"><i>King of</i> Tydore
<i>poison&rsquo;d</i>.</span> his Usurpation establish&rsquo;d by Time,
and a good Disposition in the Minds of his Accomplices, poison&rsquo;d
the King; and possessing himself of the Palace and Forts, ascended the
Throne, making the Subjects swear Allegiance to him. Tho&rsquo; no Man
in all those Eastern Parts expected any other Event, yet was it
look&rsquo;d upon as most certain, that <i>Tristan de Atayde</i> was
consenting to the Poisoning, and his Usurpation; besides other
Circumstances produc&rsquo;d so prove his Guilt, it was notorious, that
<i>Atayde</i> sent <i>Catabruno</i> a Robe of blew Velvet, which he
wore the Day he rebell&rsquo;d, and was sworn King. God so
order&rsquo;d it, that as soon as he <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb43" href="#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>was possess&rsquo;d of
the Kingdom, he broke his Faith with <i>Tristan de Atayde</i>, and
confederated with the other United Princes, proving the greatest Enemy
the <i>Portugueses</i> had; for he fitted out numerous Fleets wherewith
he warr&rsquo;d on all the Christians of those Islands, threatning and
tormenting them that they might renounce their Faith.</p>
<p>At this time the Governour of <i>India</i>, tho&rsquo; there were
some Troubles at <span class="marginnote">Galvam <i>sent to govern
the</i> Moluccos.</span> <i>Goa</i>, and in other Places, sent Succours
to <i>Ternate</i>, because it was towards the End of Summer, and one
must of Necessity go to succeed the Governour. <i>Antony Galvam</i> was
the Man appointed, who laid out above 10000 Ducats of his own towards
restoring the Places that had been burnt, by which it may be truly
said, he redeem&rsquo;d the <i>Moluccos</i>. He was desirous, not only
to People, but even to enlarge <i>Ternate</i>, and to this Purpose he
treated with some poor marry&rsquo;d Men, and needy Families, to go
over with him and their Wives and Children to those Islands; the same
he did with Men and Women, who were lewd Livers, that they might mend
their Lives in another Country, and embrace the legal State of
Matrimony; to which End, he lent them Money, and provided Necessaries
for their Voyage. In the meanwhile, the Tyrant <i>Catabruno</i>,
assembled his Forces, and mov&rsquo;d against the City <i>Momoya</i>,
where the <i>Sangiack</i> of it liv&rsquo;d, who had been before an
ignorant Idolater, but then a Christian Prince. He finding himself
inferiour in Power, retired into a Fort, with his Wife, Children
<span class="marginnote">Momoya <i>taken</i>.</span> and Family. Some
<i>Portugueses</i> sent him by <i>Tristan de Atayde</i>, not daring to
trust themselves shut up there with him, withdrew into the Mountains,
where they were soon kill&rsquo;d, pursuant to the Edict of the League.
<i>Catabruno</i> enter&rsquo;d the City, without any Opposition, where
he exercis&rsquo;d his Cruelty, because the wretched Inhabitants would
not quit it; and many new converted Christians recanted for Fear, or
thro&rsquo; the Violence of Torments. Being Master of the City, he laid
Seige to the Fort, giving it several furious Assaults, which <i>Don
John</i> withstood, making a resolute Defence, and in some Sallies
return&rsquo;d Victorious; yet his Example prevailed <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Amazing Action of an</i> Indian <i>Convert</i>.</span>
not on his People, as it usually does where it meets with generous
Souls; so that this Prince soon discover&rsquo;d how faint-hearted most
of them were; he suspected that servile Fear would degenerate to such
Baseness, that they would deliver him up to his Enemy, and therefore
like a brave Man, he presently bent his Thoughts to secure the
Salvation of his Soul. He knew <i>Catabruno</i> valu&rsquo;d himself
upon his Zeal for the Law of <i>Mahomet,</i> and therefore spar&rsquo;d
the Lives of all Christians that Apostatiz&rsquo;d, putting to Death
such as prov&rsquo;d stanch and constant; he fear&rsquo;d his Wife and
Children, being pusilanimous, would fail in the Confession of their
Faith, and being fill&rsquo;d with this Spirit, drew his Cimiter, ran
to them, and shedding Tears, which were not the Effect of Cowardice,
slew them one after another, first telling them his Reasons for so
doing, and that tho&rsquo; in the Eyes of the World he might appear
inhumane, yet considering the Salvation of their Souls, what he did was
a Religious Magnanimity, and therefore they ought rather to thank him
for it. This was a mistaken Notion; and to go through stitch with it,
he would, still persisting in the same Error, have kill&rsquo;d
himself, but that he was hinder&rsquo;d by his own Servants, who to
purchase the Tyrant&rsquo;s Pardon, deliver&rsquo;d up to him that
Christian Prince, who had been so ill advis&rsquo;d by his Zeal. Being
brought <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span>before <i>Catabruno</i>, who was inform&rsquo;d
how cruelly he had slain his Wife and Children, he ask&rsquo;d him, Why
he had undertaken so barbarous and inhumane an Action? <i>Don John</i>
answer&rsquo;d him with great Courage and Undauntedness. <i>At that
Time, and in my Thoughts, I had more regard to the Salvation of their
Souls, than to the preserving of their Lives. I mistrusted</i>
<span class="marginnote"><i>His Words.</i></span> <i>the Sex, their
Age, and your Torments, and would not hazard their persisting in the
true Faith. Souls are Immortal, and I took nothing from my Children
that they can feel the want of, or which Time, or your Sword would not
have depriv&rsquo;d them of; the latter we should all have been
thankful to, as the Instrument of the Divine Will. But I much more
dreaded your Pardon and Mercy, by which you might have perverted their
Minds, with those Soothings which please frail Mortality. I being more
resolute, tho&rsquo; expos&rsquo;d to all your Fury, am so far from
fearing the Effects, either of your Torments or Intreaties, that I
shall look upon you as God&rsquo;s Executioner, and were it his Will,
that you should take away my Life, I should receive a greater Benefit
from your Sword, than from your Mercy. Catabruno</i>, enrag&rsquo;d at
his Answer, order&rsquo;d him to be kill&rsquo;d; but the
Tyrant&rsquo;s own Friends, who lov&rsquo;d <i>Don John</i>, the
<i>Sangiack</i>, carry&rsquo;d him out of the Room, and contriv&rsquo;d
he should have his Liberty, and be restor&rsquo;d. Their Intreaties
prevail&rsquo;d on <i>Catabruno</i>, and he liv&rsquo;d many Years
after in his own Dominions, with a Christian Constancy, confessing his
indiscreet Zeal, which had caused his own Sword to deprive him of Wife
and Children. A Mind truly worthy the best Part of <i>Europe</i>, and
not to be the Product of the most remote barbarous Nations; and highly
commendable, had it been directed by more solid Rules, to curb that
Fierceness, so opposite to all natural and divine Laws, which looks
upon such horrid Murders, as a Piece of Piety.</p>
<p><i>Tristan de Atayde</i> was troubl&rsquo;d at these Misfortunes,
which were almost <span class="marginnote"><i>Several
Actions.</i></span> under his Eyes; tho&rsquo; he wanted not for others
nearer, for the People of <i>Ternate</i> being now Masters of the
Island, burnt all the new and old Towns, belonging either to
themselves, or the Christians, and amongst others, those of
<i>Trutupalate</i>, <i>Calamata</i>, and <i>Isico</i>, yet they met
with brave Opposition in them all, and they cost much Blood. Twice our
Men went out to Fight the <i>Tydore</i> Fleet, which came within sight
of the Fort, and tho&rsquo; they both times retir&rsquo;d
Shatter&rsquo;d, and well Beaten, the Barbarians had not much cause to
Boast of their Victory, for Abundance of them were kill&rsquo;d, and
scarce any went off unhurt. The Confederates fitted out other numerous
Fleets, wherewith they much Streightened the Christians in the Fort,
till <i>Antony Galvam</i> arriv&rsquo;d, who was at this time Sailing.
But Relief came before, <i>Don Stephen de Gama</i>, sending a Galeon
laden with Provisions and Ammunition to <i>Ternate</i>, under the
Command of <i>Simon Sodre</i>. The Galeon arriv&rsquo;d safe, and with
it the Support of those Disconsolate People. They took Heart, and
ventur&rsquo;d to go abroad, spreading themselves about the Island, and
going into the Woods, met with ruin&rsquo;d Buildings, the remains
whereof still smoked, and when it was Dark, they observ&rsquo;d the
high Flames on the Mountains. However they made Incursions upon the
Barbarians and throughout all the Islands there were hourly
Engagements, either with the Christian Inhabitants, or the Soldiers of
the Forts; and at Sea they heard the Martial Musick, which Sounded
whilst they Sail&rsquo;d, or Fought Manfully, and at that time was
dreadful. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name=
"pb45">45</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the mean while Captain <i>Alvarado</i>, a <i>Spanish</i>
Gentleman, sent by <i>Ferdinand Cortes</i> to <i>Ternate</i>, that the
Valour he had shown in those Parts, serving <span class=
"marginnote">Spaniards <i>at the</i> Papuas.</span> God and his King,
might not lie idle, discover&rsquo;d the Islands of the <i>Papuas</i>,
and fought those Barbarians with Resolution, tho&rsquo; the
<i>Portuguese</i> Histories assign the Honour of this Discovery to
<i>Don George de Meneses</i> who arriv&rsquo;d at them in the Year
1526, as we have seen. The great Commander <i>Alvarado</i> also
Discover&rsquo;d other Islands, call&rsquo;d <i>Gelles</i>, in one
Degree of North Latitude, and East from <i>Ternate</i>, 125 Leagues
from <i>Batochina</i>. The Natives of those Islands are like those of
the <i>Moluccos</i> in Colour, Habit, and Customs, differing only in
Language, which is peculiar to themselves.</p>
<p><i>Antony Galvam</i> sail&rsquo;d from <i>Malaca</i> with the proper
<i>Monson</i>, with <span class="marginnote">Galvam <i>Fights at
Sea</i>.</span> the Men, and all Necessaries to fight, and settle
Colonies. When he was past the Island <i>Borneo</i>, and the ridges or
Rocks which lie under Water, in sight of that Coast, as <i>F.
Marta</i>, the Jesuit, writes to the Governor <i>Gomez Perez</i>, and
appears by his Papers, in Sight of <i>Malaca</i> he Discover&rsquo;d a
great Fleet of <i>Carcoas</i>, and other <i>Chinese</i> Ships, with
Sails made of Canes, and Palm-Tree Leaves wove together. He was soon
satisfy&rsquo;d, that they were the Auxiliaries which had joyn&rsquo;d
the <i>Janguas</i> of <i>Tydore</i> and <i>Catabruno</i>, who, with the
expell&rsquo;d King of <i>Ternate</i>, were Cruzing to meet the
<i>Portugueses</i>, or <i>Spaniards</i>, that should come into their
Seas. <i>Galvam</i> order&rsquo;d his Men to be in a Readiness, to
clear his Guns, and prepare all Things, doing the Duty of a Commander,
and of a Soldier. The Enemy drew up in three Lines, each of its
particular Nation, as if the <i>Portugueses</i> had many Ships. He was
himself in the Trading Galeon, and with it a Pink, and another small
Vessel, wherein, among the Marry&rsquo;d Men, and Families unfit for
that Service, there were some few that could take up Arms. The Infidels
drew near, but without Artillery, the <i>Gilolo</i> Archers let fly a
great number of Arrows upon our Men, and then one Line shearing off,
the other discharg&rsquo;d, the Air resounding, being peirc&rsquo;d by
the Darts, and <i>Calabays</i>, or Staves hardned at the Fire.
<i>Galvam</i> not regarding the Danger, tho&rsquo; at first he defended
himself with Fights and Planks; when he thought they had spent most of
those flying-Weapons, among which they fir&rsquo;d some Muskets, he
began to play his great Guns, tearing their Vessels, and destroying the
Men. He Sunk a considerable number, and Took several, because they
fought disorderly, relying, as it were a Land-fight, on the Multitude
of their Soldiers, as ours did on their Valour, and Experience. But
<i>Galvam</i>, whose Business it was to get to <i>Ternate</i>, held on
his Voyage, and arriv&rsquo;d <span class="marginnote"><i>Arrives
at</i> Ternate.</span> there as he desir&rsquo;d. His Men landed in
that dismal Solitude, among Smoke and Ruins. The Joy of those who were
in the Fort, and the extraordinary Relief, coming quite unhop&rsquo;d
for, were an Encouragement to them all. The Clergy came out to receive
him, the Soldiers shouting amidst the Divine Hymns, confounding the
Procession, and their Satisfaction. It was a Pleasure to behold, and
they gazed on him as a Deliverer sent from Heaven. <i>Tristan de
Atayde</i> resign&rsquo;d his Post, and <i>Antony Galvam</i> took
Possession, enquir&rsquo;d into the Nature of the Confederacy, and the
Fame of his Arrival being spread Abroad, Things began to mend. To this
Purpose he arrested <i>Tristan de Atayde</i>, and afterwards sent him
to <i>Goa</i>. He had before sent Messengers to the Queen, to acquaint
her with his Arrival, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46"
name="pb46">46</a>]</span>and the End of it, which was to serve her,
and retrieve all the Mischiefs an inordinate Desire of Revenge had
occasion&rsquo;d. In the mean while he began to repair the City, the
Colonies, Churches, Keys, and Houses, distributing those Families he
had brought with him. Nor did he neglect Husbandry, but planted Vines
brought from <i>Portugal</i>, which he soon saw grown up into
substantial Vinyards. He deliver&rsquo;d to the Clergy the new
Constitutions drawn up by Cardinal <i>Henry</i>, afterwards the last K.
of the House of <i>Portugal</i>. He offer&rsquo;d Peace to all that
would comply, sent Religious Men to inculcate to those who liv&rsquo;d
like Outlaws, the Love of their Country, its re-establishment, and how
dishonourable it was to them to make choice of a Life like that of wild
Beasts, only for a cruel Satisfaction.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Strength of the Natives.</i></span> The
Queen, who not to speak of her natural Fierceness, expected to see her
Son restor&rsquo;d, and set at Liberty, and to drive away the
<i>Portugueses</i>, would not give Ear to any Accommodation. The
greatest Burden of the War lay then upon <i>Tydore</i>, where the
Confederate Kings, with the deposed <i>Dayalo</i>, a most Fierce Man,
gather&rsquo;d above Fifty Thousand Fighting Men; but they had not yet
enclosed that City with a Wall and Ditch, being satisfy&rsquo;d with
having built a Fort upon high Rocks, whence they spread abroad to pick
up the Fishermen, and other <i>Portugueses</i> that went out from
<i>Ternate</i> to get Provisions, and thence they infested that
dangerous Coast. <i>Galvam</i> fearing lest the Prolonging of the War
should reduce him to the former difficulties, sent other Messengers to
treat of Peace, and perswade those obstinate Kings, to Publish an
Oblivion of all past Wrongs, without taking Notice of the late
engagement, offering them mighty Presents, to purchase Commerce at the
Price of them. They being puffed up with some good Success, and their
mighty Power; would not hearken to any Proposals Peace; but on the
contrary, as <i>Maff&aelig;us</i> Writes, they return&rsquo;d an Answer
very abusive to the <i>Portugueses</i>. <i>Galvam</i> imploring the
Assistance of Heaven, so managed the Affair, that it was look&rsquo;d
upon as amazing, even by such as view Things impartially. Nor would it
be credible, unless comfirm&rsquo;d <span class="marginnote">Galvam
<i>sails over to Attack them</i>.</span> by other Enterprizes of his
suitable to this. He had only four Tall Ships, and a few smaller
Vessels in the Port; these he speedily form&rsquo;d into a Squadron,
putting in 400 Men, 170 of them <i>Portugueses</i>, the rest to make up
the Number, Slaves, and the common sort of <i>Ternate</i>. He left
<i>Tristan de Atayde</i> with some Men to defend the Fort, and secure
<i>Sultan Aerio</i>, and sail&rsquo;d away himself for <i>Tydore</i>,
without meeting any Enemy, the reason of it not known, and lay by in a
safe Place, about a Musket-shot from that Island. Being come to an
Anchor, he took a full View of the Multitude that guarded the Shores,
considering the Nature of the Country, and Situation of the City.
Having called a Council of War, he resolv&rsquo;d to Storm the Fort on
the high Rock, then little regarded, the Confederates thinking
themselves safe. He made a Speech to them in plain Terms, without any
Rhetorical Ornaments. <i>These are the same People,</i> said he, <i>we
have so newly Vanquish&rsquo;d, to restore whom to the Liberty they
desire, would be a matter of small moment, did they when possessed of
it allow the Freedom of preaching the Gospel. This is the Cause we are
imbark&rsquo;d in. Who then can doubt of Victory, or not wish to Die
for the obtaining of it? As these Enemies are the same we Defeated, so
are we the same Victors; so that I need not have Recourse to Foreign
Examples, to encourage you. Their Disobedience and Restlessness is of a
long standing; it will be but reasonable that our Arms <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>add one
Victorious Day to so many Turbulent Years, that so we may lay the Ax to
the Root of Rebellion. They call us Tyrants; that does not at all
trouble me; because after the Victory, we shall have the Opportunity of
dispelling that Slander by our Moderation.</i></p>
<p>They would not suffer <i>Galvam</i> to put an end to his Speech, all
of them <span class="marginnote"><i>The manner of the
Attack.</i></span> pressing earnestly to Fight, and he resolving to
make himself Master of the Rock, as he had contriv&rsquo;d,
pick&rsquo;d out 120 <i>Portugueses</i>, and made out 300 from among
the Rest, leaving the Remainder to secure the Ships, and keep the Enemy
in Play, if they should attack them; making show of a greater Number,
by appearing in several Places, and shouting, by which such as fear are
easily imposed upon. In the mean while, <i>Galvam</i> having taken a
Native of <i>Tydore</i>, and oblig&rsquo;d him to serve for a Guide,
set out at the fourth Watch in the Night with his Men, through by-ways
remote from the City, over-grown with Brambles, and scarce practicable,
and with the greatest silence he could came to the Top of the Mountain.
The <i>Portugueses</i> had march&rsquo;d the greatest Part of the Way
by the first Dawn of Day, and resting them a little from the Fatigue,
descry&rsquo;d the Enemy&rsquo;s shining Helmets and their Feathers on
them. <i>Galvam</i> then beginning, all the rest raised the Cry, <i>To
Arms, to Arms</i>. The Confederates, with Horrid Shouts, which
resounded on the Rocks, and in the Woods, made ready for their Defence,
notwithstanding the surprize; but soon perceived they should fall a
Prey to our Men. The Fight began, and King <i>Dayalo</i>, enrag&rsquo;d
for that he had been depos&rsquo;d, appear&rsquo;d the foremost with
some Troops, to secure the Passes, and advanced to meet the
<i>Portugueses</i> in a Plain. They avoided him not, and both Parties
mixing, much Blood was spilt. <i>Dayalo</i> was visible by his bright
Helmet, adorn&rsquo;d with Variety of standing high Feathers,
<span class="marginnote"><i>King of</i> Ternate
<i>Kill&rsquo;d</i>.</span> and his Body cover&rsquo;d with a Steel
Coat of Mail, brandishing with both Hands a Lance, as like a small Yard
of a Ship, and charging with desperate Fury; but happ&rsquo;ning to
rush in among our Pikes and Musketiers, unadvisedly, he receiv&rsquo;d
several Wounds on all Sides, and fell down raging. He was wonderful
strong, and started up immediately; concealing his Wounds and Pain, and
beginning a fresh Charge in the first Ranks, for fear of discouraging
his Men. He Fought a considerable Time; but not being Dress&rsquo;d,
and the Action causing the Blood to run the faster, his Eye sight
fail&rsquo;d him, and he dropt a second Time, saying to his Guards,
<i>Move hence as fast as you can, and carry me carefully that the
Dogs</i>, so he call&rsquo;d the <i>Portugueses</i>, <i>may not have
the Satisfaction of cutting my Body in Pieces</i>. His Soldiers did so,
not without great Danger; and he soon after he had been carry&rsquo;d
off, gave up his haughty Soul. His Forces daunted by this Accident,
turn&rsquo;d their Backs, hiding themselves among the Rocks and
Brambles, <span class="marginnote"><i>The</i> Indians
<i>routed</i><span class="corr" id="xd21e5637" title=
"Not in source">.</span></span> throwing down their Arms, and getting
off through almost inaccessible Ways. Others return&rsquo;d to the
City, and meeting some Troops that march&rsquo;d to their Assistance,
made them return another Way. The <i>Portugueses</i> follow&rsquo;d the
Chace, killing such as fled, and <i>Galvam</i> came to the Fort, with
the Loss of only one Slave. This Victory, which happen&rsquo;d on the
Feast of St. <i>Thomas</i>, the Apostle, in the Year 1537, humbled the
Pride of the Confederates; was ascrib&rsquo;d to the Intercession of
that Apostle, and they observ&rsquo;d a solemn Thanksgiving. The Fort
was fired with good Advice, for the Citizens and Traders, seeing the
Flames so near, abandon&rsquo;d <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48"
href="#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>their Houses, and departed the
City with the flying Multitude. <i>Galvam</i> was now coming down from
the Hill, having drawn together his Men, and form&rsquo;d them into
small Bodies, with sound of Trumpets and Singing, to make his
Victorious Entry into that City, now void of Defendants, and full of
Wealth. Considering that the Avarice of the Victorious Soldiers
spur&rsquo;d them on to take Possession of that inestimable Booty, for
all the <span class="marginnote">Tydore <i>burnt</i>.</span> Merchants
had brought their Effects to <i>Tydore</i>, as the safest Place.
<i>Galvam</i> order&rsquo;d to set Fire to the Houses, all which were
consum&rsquo;d with their harmless Treasure, in Sight of those who had
hop&rsquo;d to be Masters of it; only the Provisions being
providentially sav&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>Of the People of <i>Tydore</i> as many were taken as did not in Time
save themselves by Flight; as also a Junk in the Port, and several
other small Vessels. The Enemies afterwards perish&rsquo;d in other
smaller Actions. The daunted King, hasted Home to secure their own
Lands, disolving the Confederacy, and being sufficiently warn&rsquo;d,
gave Ear to, and <span class="marginnote"><i>Peace
concluded.</i></span> embrac&rsquo;d Proposals of Peace; taking leave
of him of <i>Tydore</i>, and agreeing with <i>Galvam</i>, whose Vertue
and Discretion gain&rsquo;d so much upon <i>Cachil Rade</i>, that
King&rsquo;s Brother, that he came to a Conference with him and
concluded a Peace upon certain Conditions. The King of <i>Tydore</i>
oblig&rsquo;d himself to restore <i>Galvam</i> the Cannon; not to
assist the Enemies of <i>Portugal</i>; not to permit the Clove to be
dispos&rsquo;d of into any other Hands than the <i>Portuguese</i>
Officers; and to sell it as was usual at <i>Ternate</i>. <i>Galvam</i>
went over next to subdue <i>Gilolo</i>, and the other Kings, all which
he compass&rsquo;d successfully. The Queen also submitted, either on
Account of the King of <i>Tydore</i>&rsquo;s Falshood, or that, as she
said, she grew weary of the War, or else because the depos&rsquo;d King
was kill&rsquo;d. <i>Catabruno</i> was appeas&rsquo;d by
<i>Galvam</i>&rsquo;s good Behaviour, and accepted of Conditions, among
which the chiefest was, that <i>Galvam</i> should set <i>Sultan
Aerio</i> at Liberty. Thus the Confederacy was dissolv&rsquo;d, and the
<i>Maluccos</i> laying down Arms, submitted again. Provisions were
furnish&rsquo;d as before, and the Crops, and Trade of Spice were
restor&rsquo;d.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Sultan Aerio <i>King of</i> Ternate.</span>
<i>Sultan Aerio</i> attended by the Christians and Gentiles, Dancing,
and making other demonstrations of Joy, went from the Fort to his
Palace, where he remain&rsquo;d with his Guard, and Family. Before he
Marry&rsquo;d, tho&rsquo; he never wanted for Concubines, he in Person
took a Progress to the principal places in his Dominions of
<i>Ternate</i>, <i>Moutil</i>, and <i>Machian</i>. Those in the Fort
attended and assisted him, together with the <i>Sangiacks</i>, who went
all about that <i>Archipelago</i>, first on that side they call <i>Del
Moro</i>, that is towards <i>Batochina</i>, and is distant from the
<i>Moluccos</i> 60 Leagues Northward, beginning at the Isles of
<i>Doe</i>, two Leagues to the Point of <i>Bicoe</i>. All these are
Inhabited by Wild People.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><span class="corr" id="xd21e5772" title=
"Source: Batachina">Batochina</span>, <i>that is</i> Gilolo
<i>describ&rsquo;d</i>.</span> <i>Batochina</i> is 250 Leagues in
Compass, and Subject to two Kings, which are those of <i>Gylolo</i>,
and <i>Lolada</i>. This last is Ancienter than all those of the
<i>Moluccos</i>, or in those Seas, and formerly was the most Powerful;
but now the Weakest. The Inhabitants of the North part of
<i>Batochina</i> are Savage, without any King, Laws, or Towns, living
in Deserts. Those on the East-side have populous Towns, on the Sea
Shore; and tho&rsquo; they speak several Languages, yet they understand
one another. This Coast they call&rsquo;d <i>Morotia</i>, that is,
<i>Land Moor</i>. The other Islands opposite are call&rsquo;d
<i>Morotay</i>, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name=
"pb49">49</a>]</span>that is, <i>Sea-Moor</i>, and all those Isles
breed deceitful, brutal and dastardly Men. Only the City <i>Moncoya</i>
is Warlike. It ever wanted Laws, Weights, Measures, Coin, Gold, Silver,
and all other Metals, and a King; but it is overstock&rsquo;d with
Provisions, Arms, Idols, and Devils speaking in them. The Women Till
the Land. Each of these Towns is Govern&rsquo;d by a Magistrate chosen
by the People; they pay him no Taxes, but have Regard to his Descent.
The <i>Molucco</i> Kings conquer&rsquo;d them, and every one kept what
he could get; the better part belongs to him of <i>Ternate</i>, and
less to the King of <i>Tydore</i>, whose Dominions were enlarg&rsquo;d
by the Power of Spain. They went on to establish their Possessions
among the <i>Papuas</i>, or <i>Papous</i>, East from the
<i>Moluccos</i>, being Islands little resorted to, because many of them
are all encompass&rsquo;d with Flats and Shoals. The Natives of them
are Black, like the <i>Cafres</i>; they wear their Hair wound about in
large curl&rsquo;d <span class="marginnote">Papuas, <i>or</i>
Papous.</span> Locks, their Visages lean and ugly. The Name of
<i>Papuas</i> in their Language signifies Blacks, being a stern People,
enur&rsquo;d to Labour, and fit for any piece of Treachery. All their
Islands are subject to Kings, and abound in Gold, which they do not
Transport, because no Man lays up any more of it than is us&rsquo;d in
their Ornaments. Among these Black-men there are some as White and fair
as the <i>Germans</i>; if these go out in the Sun, they are struck
blind, tho they do not look at it. Those in <i>Spain</i> are
call&rsquo;d <i>Albinos</i>; yet some of them are strong, and can
behold any Object. Among these <i>Papuas</i> there are many deaf. As to
the Extent of this Country, if we may believe the Accounts of
<i>Spanish</i> Pilots, who have sail&rsquo;d that way, these Islands
run along a vast Continent, which terminates at the Streights of
<i>Magellan</i>. These Kings entertain Friendship with <i>Ternate</i>,
whither they sent Embassadors, and as much as was here subject to the
<i>Moluccos</i>, had no Share in the desperate Fury of the League. So
did those of <i>Celebes</i> to the Westward, being many notable
Islands, the great Island <i>Celebes</i> it self, as also
<i>Mindanas</i>; so those of <i>Bisaya</i>, abounding in Iron;
<i>Mascaga</i>, and <i>Masbate</i>, which have much Gold, as well as
<i>Mindanas</i>; that of <i>Sologo</i>, and others producing
Provisions, Spice, Sanders, Eaglewood, <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Other <span class="corr" id="xd21e5901" title=
"Source: Issands">Islands</span>.</i></span> Cinnamon, Camphire,
Tortoshell, Ginger, and Long Pepper. Some of these Islands are subject
to the King of <i>Borneo</i>, others to those of <i>Tydore</i> and
<i>Bachian</i>, but the most to him of <i>Ternate</i>. The People are
generally treacherous; many of them go naked, painting their Bodies in
Falcage, and other Figures; their Hair long, hanging on their Backs, or
else knotted, and cut short over the Forehead, like our Peasants; their
Faces large; their Teeth well shap&rsquo;d and black; and their Ears
bor&rsquo;d. The Natives of <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Celebes.</i></span> <i>Celebes</i> are filthy, and vile
in their Behaviour; the &AElig;quinoctial passes over their Island,
which is full of little Towns; a whole Race living in every House. On
their Walls they hang the Hair of those they have kill&rsquo;d in War;
and the greatest number of them is most Honourable. There are among
them several sorts of Monstrous Productions. One of these is a Tree
bearing a vast Head, the shade whereof kills any Man that lyes down
under it on the West-side, unless he immediately lye down on the
East-side; the same shade at only a Yard distance being an Antidote
against its opposite Malignity. In these Towns there are horrid Stews
of Sodomy; tho there are no such at <i>Ternate</i>; but they have gone
as far as <i>Amboyna</i>, which lyes South of it. Among the
<i>Moluccos</i> there are many Islands subject <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span>to their
own Chiefs, full of excellent Waters, and delightful Banks. Formerly
they were free, afterwards conquer&rsquo;d by the Kings of
<i>Ternate</i> and <i>Tydore</i>; against whom they also
rebell&rsquo;d, and submitted to the Queen of <i>Japara</i>, and many
Christian Towns were subject to the <i>Portugueses</i>. They yield
above 2000 Hundred Weight of Cloves Yearly; which the <i>Jaos</i> are
Masters of, none being to obstruct them; they go over and Barter, and
carry it away in their Junks. We speak elsewhere of their Fertility.
Our Relations tell us, they produce a fort of Reeds, or Canes, above
fifty fathom long, and no thicker than a mans little finger. South from
<i>Amboyna</i> lye the Islands of <i>Banda</i>; and about 300 Leagues
to the Eastward; some affirm, there is one which is all over an entire
Mine of Gold, and the Natives not above a Yard high. If this be so, and
these the true Pigmies, who will look upon the Battels mention&rsquo;d
in <i>Homer</i>&rsquo;s 3d <i>Iliad</i>, betwixt them and the Cranes,
as Fabulous. Those scatter&rsquo;d Dominions were again united and
submitted to <i>Sultan Aerio</i>, whose Marriage Solemnities, Building
of Masques, Publick Festivals, and other Works of Peace, we must pass
over in silence, as not proper for our purpose, they being only a
pleasing sort of Digressions.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Mezquita <i>Governs at</i> Ternate.</span>
The Kings of <i>Portugal</i> sent several Commanders in Chief to
<i>Ternate</i>, and last in the Year 1570; <i>James Lopez de
Mezquita</i>, who had commanded on the <i>Molucco</i> Seas, took
Possession of the Fort. In his Time <i>Sultan Aerio</i>, a courteous
and affable Man, continu&rsquo;d in Subjection to <i>Portugal</i>,
valuing himself upon being true to his Word in all his Actions.
Nevertheless, there wanted not some ill-meaning Persons, who
mislik&rsquo;d his Government, and pretended that he did not exercise
his Power legally. They said, he had given way to those Vices, into
which luxurious Princes are wont to fall; those being generally the
Fruits of a long Peace. They fancy&rsquo;d, he retained the Memory of
past Tragedies; and particularly his Mother&rsquo;s inhuman End, and
therefore persecuted our Religion; tho at the <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Pretences to destroy King</i> Aerio.</span> same Time
the Memories of those Days do not charge him with any Temporal
Disobedience, or want of Fidelity; but they rather compar&rsquo;d him
to <i>Massinissa</i>, King of <i>Numidia</i>; and say the
<i>Portugueses</i> ought to have respected him, as the <i>Romans</i>
did the other. The Commander hearing of those Abuses, and fearing
greater might ensue, some Religious Men encreasing his Jealousie, he
endeavour&rsquo;d to redress them by Friendly Admonitions, and other
Contrivances. Those Methods had no effect on him, for he
answer&rsquo;d, he was in his own Dominions, where, without offence to
the <i>Portuguese</i> Sovereignty, he might live as he pleas&rsquo;d.
<i>Mezquita</i> resolving to try harsher means, since the others did
not at all move the King, nor make him uneasie, as relying on his
Innocency; began to deprive him of his Revenue, and the Income of the
Spice; threatning also, that he would, in all other Respects, execute
the last Will made by his Brother <i>Tabarija</i>, wherein he appointed
the King of <i>Portugal</i> for his Heir; or at lest would treat him so
like an inferior Person, that he should scarce be able to assume the
Name of King; for such is the Punishment they are lyable to, who do not
observe that Decorum which was inviolable in their Ancestors.</p>
<p><i>Cachil Babu</i>, Son to <i>Sultan Aerio</i>, taking a Progress
about this Time, through his Father&rsquo;s Islands, a Subject came to
complain to him against certain <i>Portugueses</i>, who had taken away
his Daughter; for which fault <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href=
"#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>he order&rsquo;d them all to be
kill&rsquo;d, as if they had been accessary to the ravishing of the
Maid. He had no Directions, nor so much as the consent of King
<i>Aerio</i> for this exorbitant Command, which took no effect. On the
contrary he afterwards so generously resented it, that he order&rsquo;d
the Prince to be seiz&rsquo;d, and would have punish&rsquo;d him
severely, had he not been hindred by those the wrong was offer&rsquo;d
to. This plain Demonstration was <span class="marginnote"><i>The</i>
Portugueses <i>seize and send him to</i> Goa.</span> not sufficient to
divert the <i>Portuguese</i> Commander from imputing the Sons Fault to
the Father, contrary to all Reason and Likelihood. All discreet Methods
us&rsquo;d by well-meaning Persons to reconcile them two, failing;
<i>James Lopez</i> by his King&rsquo;s Authority, which generally is
most unreasonable, the farther it is from the Prince, from whom it is
deriv&rsquo;d, presum&rsquo;d to imprison the <i>Sultan</i>; being
dragg&rsquo;d away from a Pleasure-House, where he was passing the Heat
of the Day, among his Women; His Subjects lov&rsquo;d him, and their
Resentment for this wrong was proportionable to their Affection; nor
did the <i>Portugueses</i> approve of the Fact. The Commander
perceiving that all Men were against him, and that after all Enquiries
and Examinations, the King&rsquo;s Cause still appear&rsquo;d the
better, and his Fidelity was more visibly made out, he gave him his
Liberty, to the great Satisfaction of his Kingdoms, which were
attentive to the Event; but upon Condition he should go to <i>Goa</i>
to clear himself, where he expected they would cut off his Head, upon
the Informations he would send against him. The King set out, and
before he came to <i>Malaga</i>, the Viceroy <span class=
"marginnote"><i>The Viceroy acquits him.</i></span> writ to him,
begging he would return to his Kingdom, for he was fully
convinc&rsquo;d of his Innocence, and promis&rsquo;d to punish the
Causer of those Troubles; but at that Time, for some Considerations,
was satisfy&rsquo;d with reproving him. The K. returning to
<i>Ternate</i>, the Commander was sent Prisoner to Goa, and had been
more severely punish&rsquo;d; but that Fortune preserv&rsquo;d him, to
be an Instrument of the loss which has lasted till our Days.</p>
<p>Within a Year after his Imprisonment he was restor&rsquo;d to his
Command in <i>Ternate</i>, where be again practic&rsquo;d against that
King; for there are some <span class="marginnote"><i>Pretended
Reconciliation.</i></span> Dispositions which never part with the
Jealousies they have once conceiv&rsquo;d. <i>Ternate</i> was as it
were the Metropolis in Religious matters, and King <i>Aerio</i> had
never offer&rsquo;d any Affront to us either in Spirituals or
Temporals, for which Reason there never wanted some grave Persons in
his Court. These Zealously reconcil&rsquo;d them two, and that
perfectly, as to outward Appearance, and that their renew&rsquo;d Amity
might be lasting, the King assur&rsquo;d the Commander upon Oath,
according to his Sect, that he would never privately harbour the least
Jealousie of him; but before he admitted of any, would discover it to
him, that so he might either receive, or make Satisfaction; to the end
no Accidents might revive any Mistrusts. The <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Falshood of</i> Mezquita.</span> Commander made the
King the same solemn Promise, both of them being thus pacify&rsquo;d,
and in the Opinion of all those who mediated betwixt them, so Friendly,
that none could imagine such perfect Amity could ever be
dissolv&rsquo;d. But there being nothing less permanent among Men than
Reconciliations, the <i><span class="corr" id="xd21e6096" title=
"Source: Partuguese">Portuguese</span></i> Commander reassuming the
Hatred which never was extinct, or perhaps so much as lay&rsquo;d
aside, resolv&rsquo;d to destroy <i>Sultan Aerio</i> when only five
Days were elaps&rsquo;d since the Re-establishment of their Friendship
sworn to on both sides. This could not be kept so private, as not to
come to the <i>Sultan</i>&rsquo;s Ears; but the Consideration that he
was a King, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name=
"pb52">52</a>]</span>his own Sincerity, and the fresh Reconciliation,
made him think he was secure. But if the Nature of Man be such as not
to forgive when it has done a Wrong, what can be less secure than
injur&rsquo;d Innocence? The Commander feigns himself Sick, and sends
to desire the King, that since he is not able to wait on him in his
Palace, he will be pleas&rsquo;d to honour him with a Visit in the
Fort, there to confer with his Highness about some important Affairs
which concern the King of <i>Portugal</i>, his Master, and are not fit
to be communicated to any other. All the Answer the King
return&rsquo;d, was to go himself to Visit the Sick Man, tho&rsquo; he
had Information better grounded than on bear Surmises, that <i>Martin
Antonio Pimentel</i>, the Commanders Nephew, had Orders to murder him,
as soon as ever he came into the Fort. <span class=
"marginnote">Aerio&rsquo;s <i>Innocent Bravery</i>.</span> He could not
prevail upon himself to believe a Treacherous Design; so far does
Innocence prevail over a generous Soul. But when he saw that at the
Gate, they stopp&rsquo;d his Guards, the <i>Sangiacks</i> and
<i>Cachiles</i>, that attended him, he then began to be convinc&rsquo;d
of the Villany, yet went on without being disorder&rsquo;d, and showing
an undaunted Countenance. And tho&rsquo; he could not forbear dropping
some Tears, when he took leave of his Sons, however he presently
compos&rsquo;d his Countenance, so that he was not at all
dismay&rsquo;d, tho&rsquo; in the Commanders Nephew&rsquo;s Looks he
saw visible Tokens of his Unkles Commission. He would have
complain&rsquo;d to the Commander of the Disrespect of those who
stopp&rsquo;d his Attendance, but they would not suffer him to go on.
The Mask being now laid aside, and the true Design appearing, in
Violence he call&rsquo;d out to the <i>Sangiacks</i>, but the Gate was
shut against him and them. <i>Pimentel</i> came up to him with a Naked
Ponyard, and begg&rsquo;d his Pardon like an Executioner. The King,
without showing any Surprize, or Disorder, Bid him consider what he was
going to do; for there were many left to revenge his Death, besides his
Sons and Subjects, all the Kings of the <i>Archipelago</i>, as well the
Sovereigns who were in Alliance, as those who ow&rsquo;d Fealty to the
Crown of <i>Portugal</i>. <i>This Instance</i>, said he, <i>will make
them dread every Capricious Humour of a Commander in chief</i>. <i>If
still that Jealousie survies, which has so often been prov&rsquo;d
groundless, I will deliver my self up to the King of</i> Portugal;
<i>and if my Death be of such Consequence to you, yet respite the
Execution but a little, for at my Age, Time will soon perform what your
Swords are to do</i>. They <span class="marginnote"><i>He is
murder&rsquo;d.</i></span> now began to fall upon him, and he seeing a
Brass Cannon, on which were the Arms of <i>Portugal</i>, clasping his
Arms about it, said, <i>Christians, at least show some respect to these
Arms; for you kill a King that has paid the greatest Deference to your
Crown</i>. This last Testimony of his Innocence was of no Force to
appease those Murderers; though formerly in <i>Rome</i>, the embracing
the Statues of the Emperors was sufficient to deliver Slaves from being
punish&rsquo;d by their Masters. It may be a Question whether his Soul
was sav&rsquo;d; for there are those who affirm, he intreated the
Murderer to permit him to be Baptiz&rsquo;d; who answering, It was then
too late, without granting his Request, or any Respite, ran furiously
upon that Antient Prince, who made no Resistance, and stabb&rsquo;d him
in several Places. They carry&rsquo;d the Body into a Vault. The
King&rsquo;s Kindred and Servants heard the Noise, and suspecting the
worst; went away in great Disorder, to the City, where there was
already a confused Rumour of what had happen&rsquo;d, and being
Distracted, ran shrieking about the Streets, where nothing was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>to be heard but Weeping, Threats, Complaints and
Disorder.</p>
<p>The Principal Queen, with the Kings other Wives, and Slaves, his
Sons, and Brothers, laying a side all State<span class="corr" id=
"xd21e6169" title="Source: &rsquo;">,</span> came out of the Palace,
already surrounded by the Multitude, in Confusion and Dispair, and
being follow&rsquo;d by most of the <i>Portugueses</i>, who no less
abhorr&rsquo;d the Fact, ran to the Fort, crying out to let them see
their King, as still doubting of what they heard. <span class=
"marginnote">Mezquita&rsquo;s <i>Inhumanity</i>.</span> The Commander
appear&rsquo;d in Armour on the Wall, and said, <i>They should see him

id="xd21e6184" title="Source: wth">with</span> his Arms, Legs, and Body
cut into small pieces, all which they hung upon the Battlements in the
sight of his People. Afterwards they Salted them, as if the
perpetuating of the Wrong had been requisite. This was what most
provok&rsquo;d the injur&rsquo;d People, who no longer able to behold
so inhumane a Spectacle, and being beside themselves, and fearing more
Mischief, return&rsquo;d with their Family. The Sons out of Respect to
their Fathers Body, went away from <i>Ternate</i> to several Islands,
tho&rsquo; in Reality they departed to excite others by their Presence,
representing the Hideousness, and Horror of the Fact; and to dispose
their Revenge. For the present they were <span class="corr" id=

<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Complain&rsquo;d of at</i> Goa.</span>
Their Embassador arriv&rsquo;d at <i>Goa</i> clad in White, which is

passionately Lov&rsquo;d him; and beseeching him, in the name of them
all, to Right them against the Man, who with the Power and Authority of
the <i>Portuguese</i> Arms, had Violated the publick Faith and the Laws
of Nature. The Viceroy gave him a favourable hearing, tho&rsquo; by
that Time the matter was otherwise represented at <i>Goa</i>, at least
among the <i>Portuguese</i> Nation. They said, That King <i>Aerio</i>
going to visit the Commander <span class="marginnote"><i>False
pretences of the</i> Portugueses.</span> in Chief, <i>Martin Antonio
Pimentel</i>, went in with him, and they contended in Words upon some
Point, when the <i>Portuguese</i> answering him angrily, they fell to
their Weapons, and the King was kill&rsquo;d in the Quarrel. They
added, That he was Advis&rsquo;d so to do, by some of our Religious
Men, who were offended at the Persecution of the Christians, and the
Obstructing of the King of <i>Portugal</i>&rsquo;s Service.
<i>Pimentel</i> made his Defence with the Original Letters, of those
who perswaded him to commit the Fact, and who afterwards sav&rsquo;d
him. However the Viceroy did not Reject the Plaintifs; but
promis&rsquo;d to Right them; and to shew that he design&rsquo;d them
farther satisfaction than a bare Promise, he sent away the necessary
Supplies for the Security of the Fort of <i>Ternate</i>, and <i>Nunno
Pereyra de la Cerda</i>, a Gentleman of Courage, and the necessary
Sagacity to succeed the other in a Post where all things were in
Confusion. He also writ to King <i>Sebastian</i> of <i>Portugal</i>,
acquainting him with the Death of King <i>Aerio</i>; how Cruelly and
Unjustly he had been kill&rsquo;d; what a Revolution there was cause to
fear it might produce; whom he had sent to succeed <i>Mezquita</i>; the
Orders he had to Secure him, as also Pimentel, if he could find
him.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Pereyra <i>succeeds</i> Mezquita.</span>
<i>Nunno Pereyra</i> arriv&rsquo;d at <i>Malaco</i> with the
<i>Molucco</i> Embassador, whence, at the proper Season, they
Sail&rsquo;d to <i>Ternate</i>, where as soon as they Landed, order was
taken for Correcting the Insolency of those in the Garrisons, who
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name=
"pb54">54</a>]</span>robb&rsquo;d, and obstructed Trade. When he had
settled these Affairs, he seiz&rsquo;d the late Commander in Chief,
<i>James Lopez</i>; but did not punnish him there, in the sight of
those who had been wrong&rsquo;d, which would have appeas&rsquo;d them.
The new Commander sollicited the Kings Sons to return to
<i>Ternate</i>, and endeavour&rsquo;d to give them, and the Kingdom
Satisfaction. He easily convinc&rsquo;d them, that the Publick was no
way guilty of their Fathers Death, but only the Commander
<i>Mezquita</i>, who should be severely punish&rsquo;d. That
<span class="marginnote"><i>He fawns.</i></span> he deliver&rsquo;d
them the Kings Body, to be Bury&rsquo;d with due Honour. That they
should settle the Succession, offering it to <i>Cachil Guarate</i>,
<i>Aerio</i>&rsquo;s Eldest Son. He told them, the King of
<i>Portugal</i> did not send his Commanders to be Enemies, but
Protectors of the Royal Family and State of <i>Ternate</i>, and
therefore they should make use of his Arms, as their own. They
return&rsquo;d apparent Thanks for what <i>Pereyna</i> did, and being
indifferently satisfy&rsquo;d with his Promises, took the Kings Body. A
few Months after, on the Day appointed for the Barbarous Obsequies,
Embassadors from the neighboring Kings, and Kingdoms landed at the
City, who all repair&rsquo;d to the Palace, clad in White, with the
dead Kings Sons, and Brothers, the <i>Sangiacks</i> and Soldiers, and
the Chiefest of them, going into the Room where the Coffin was before
the Mourners, who are Officers of the Grave, began their Lamentations
<span class="marginnote"><i>Revenge vow&rsquo;d.</i></span> and Cryes,
they all swore upon the dead Body, to take a Revenge suitable to the
Wrong; but because this Resolution requir&rsquo;d a more deliberate
Preparation, they suspended it for a Year. It is reported, that Heaven
anticipated them within that time, punishing <i>Pimentel</i>, striking
him to the Heart with the Disease call&rsquo;d <i>Berber</i>, whereof
he dy&rsquo;d swelling up, and raving.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Assembly of the</i> Indians <i>to
consent</i>.</span> The Funeral Rites being perform&rsquo;d, the Prince
took leave of <i>Nunno Pereyra</i>, to go over to the Island
<i>Ires</i>, where they have a most stately Country-House, and the
principal Mosque. There they all met on pretence of Diverting
themselves after their Sorrow, tho it was now almost two Years since
the occasion of it happened. The <i>Cachilas</i> and <i>Sangiacks</i>
repair&rsquo;d thither under the same Colour, and without loosing any
Time, they proposed the Uniting the Forces of their Kingdoms, and
shaking off the <i>Portuguese</i> Yoke. <i>What shall we</i>, said
they, <i>value the</i> Portugueses, <i>if once we come to be sensible
of our own Strength? What can we Fear, or not Dare to attempt? The</i>
Portugueses <i>value him who Robs most, and is guilty of the greatest
Crimes and Enormities. The forcing away of our Product, their one lewd
Pleasures, and our Wrongs, are Occasion for them to make War; ours are
our Country, and the Defence of our Parents, our Wives, our Children,
and our Liberty. It is necessary to expedite the Execution, because a
Secret is not lasting among many, and in Affairs of this Nature, there
is more Danger in Consulting, than even in Execution. We have been
already too long in Confusion, without a Head.</i> No Man contradicted;
but neither <i>Cachil Guarate</i>, the Eldest of the Brothers, nor the
Second, durst take upon them so difficult an Enterprize. <i>Cachil
Babre</i>, the Third, undertok it, with the usual Ingagement, either to
Conquer, or to Dye. They presently lifted him up, with general
Applause, and his Election being made publick, the Kingdom easily
submitted to him, through the desire of Revenge; tho&rsquo; according
to the Custom of the <i>Molucco</i> Islands, as soon as the King has
any Son born, they swear him his Successor, in his turn, and there was
then no need <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span>of any other Oath, yet they again swore to
<i>Cochil Babu</i>. This done, they went out to their Mosque, in
Procession, to offer Sacrifice. A Boy went foremost with a naked Sword
on his Shoulder, and with the other Hand <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Sacrifice.</i></span> leading a Kid, which was to be
the Victim, with the <span class="corr" id="xd21e6380" title=
"Source: li tle">little</span> Horns Gilt. The <i>Alcoran</i> forbids
Sacrifising; but these Islanders receive the Rites of
<i>Mahometanism</i> so confus&rsquo;dly, that with them they also
retain those of their ancient Idolatry, and intermix the Ceremonies. He
that conducts the Sacrifize, is, according to their Custom,
follow&rsquo;d by part of the Kings Soldiers, with their Pikes
advanc&rsquo;d, and after them goes one holding up on high a small Gold
Vessel, or Pan, with burning Coals in it, the Frankincense they throw
in Smoking. Next to him was the new King, over whose Head they always
carry an Umbrello, made of Feathers of several Colours, in shape of a
large Semicircle. The King was encompass&rsquo;d by those Soldiers,
that are given him by his Subjects by way or Acknowledgement, like the
<i>Turkish Janizaries</i>. In this Order they came to the Mosque, at
whose Gates, whensoever they are to enter, they find Kettles and Pots
full of Water, to wash their Hands and Feet before they go in. As soon
as the King was upon the Threshold the Musick play&rsquo;d, and they
spread Milk-white Carpets, as is the Custome: Kneeling on them, they
mutter out their vain Prayers, bowing their Heads down to the Ground.
In the midst of the Mosque stands a Pulpit, cover&rsquo;d with white
Cloth. Instead of a Bell, there hangs up the holy great flat Drum,
which they beat with Sticks; tho each Mosque has a great Bell, without
a Clapper, which they strike with a Stone, or piece of Iron, when
requisite. All that hear it, of what Condition soever, repair to the
Temple, with Pikes, Shields, Cymitars, and Muskets. The profane
Sacrifice being ended, they conducted the new King to the Harbour; he
went into his <i>Carcoa</i>, with his Family, and the other
<i>Sangiacks</i>, and <span class="marginnote"><i>The King&rsquo;s</i>
Carcoa.</span> great Men, into many others. The King&rsquo;s is so
contriv&rsquo;d, that there is a Gang-way all round it, made of Canes.
There are two Slaves to each Oar; others do the Service of the Vessel,
and near every one lies a Number of Arrows. Instead of Oars they use a
sort of great Paddles, like Spoons, with which they also lade out the
Water the Vessel takes in. On the upper part they make Musick with
their Tabors, and Sounding-Basons of Metal, according to which they Row
faster or slower, as we Dance to our Musick. In the same Place there
are seven Brass Guns; a considerable number of Pikes advanc&rsquo;d,
longer than ours, and a Bed adorn&rsquo;d with Quilts interwoven with
Gold, and by it hung the King&rsquo;s Helmet, Breast, and Back Plates.
He sat, or lay on that rich Bed, the Servants of his Bed-Chamber
Fanning him with a large Wing, made of various colour&rsquo;d Feathers
of the Birds that fly about his Islands; thus he Coasted about, the Sea
and Shore resounding with Guns, Shouts, and Barbarous Instruments.</p>
<p>At the same time that they seem&rsquo;d to be wholly taken up with
Sports and Diversions, in the Island <i>Ires</i>, they Vow&rsquo;d an
irreconciliable Enmity <span class="marginnote"><i>War
Proclaim&rsquo;d.</i></span> to the <i>Portuguese</i> Nation, with the
same Solemnity as they had sworn Allegiance to their King; and this
Secret having been inviolably observ&rsquo;d, when the new K. thought
convenient he caused it to be Publish&rsquo;d throughout all his
Dominions, which consists of seventy two Islands in that
<i>Archipelago</i>, betwixt those of <i>Mindanao</i>, on the North;
<i>Bima</i> and <i>Corca</i> on the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56"
href="#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span><span class=
"marginnote"><i>Dominions of</i> Ternate.</span> South; and the
Continent of the <i>Papuas</i>, or <i>Papous</i>, otherwise
call&rsquo;d <i>New Guinea</i> on the East: The Inhabitants whereof pay
him their Tribute in Gold, Amber, and Birds of Paradise; all which
Provinces have been Usurped from other Kings, on whose Ruins his Pride
is swollen so high, that he stiles himself in his own Language, Emperor
of the <i>Archipelago</i>. In most of them there were at that Time some
Christian Towns, Churches, and Preachers, and the Gospel was
receiv&rsquo;d in the eight principal Nations. Idolater and Mahometan
Embassadours came from them all to acknowledge, and swear Fealty to
<i>Cachil Rabu</i>. In this great Assembly the Desire of Revenge was
made the Cause of Religion, and in it began the longest Persecution the
true Faith has undergone in our Days. It will be therefore requisite,
distinctly to describe the remote, and neighbouring Countries and
Nations that carry&rsquo;d it on; and the Strength, and standing
Forces, <span class="marginnote"><i>Forces of the Kings of</i> Ternate
<i>and Provinces</i>.</span> they have ready at all times upon any
Occasion.</p>
<p>The sixteen greater Towns of <i>Ternate</i> furnish their K. with
3000 Arm&rsquo;d Men; the Island of <i>Montil</i>, distant from it six
Leagues South, 200; that of <i>Machian</i>, eight Leagues distant,
1500; that of <i>Caioa</i> four Leagues from <i>Mechian</i>, the same

eighty Leagues from <i>Amboina</i>, and are the same Number of Leagues
in compass 50000; those of <i>Buaro</i>, and <i>Manipa</i>, lying
betwixt those of <i>Veranula</i> and <i>Burro</i>, 3000; those of
<i>Na</i>, <i>Nolo</i>, and <i>New Guinea</i>, which are many, and very
populous, fifty Leagues East from <i>Ternate</i>, send no certain, but
numerous Forces; that of <i>Ires</i>, where the King then was, 400; and
pays Tribute in Amber, and Birds of Paradise. Those of <i>Meaos</i> and

Leagues from <i>Ternate</i>, 10000. The large Island <i>Matheo</i>,
contains several Kingdoms, thirty Leagues to the Westward, each of them
subject to its own King, and all of them to him of <i>Ternate</i>; send
him Arm&rsquo;d Troops. <i>Totole</i> <span class="corr" id="xd21e6564"

<i>Butu</i> are all subject to him, and the number of their supplies is
uncertain; but <i>Sanguien</i> and its King, 40 Leagues from
<i>Ternate</i>, serve him with 3000 Men. This was not the standing
Force, which without adding to it the uncertain number, nor the
multitude of slaves, amounts to 120300 Men. This particular <i>F.
Martin</i> sent to the Governor <i>Gamez Parez</i>, and the original
was deliver&rsquo;d to me. Since then, that Kings Power is increased,
and because more Formidable, by reason of his Alliances with several
Princes, entering Amity with some, and Oppressing others, and
practising the Rules of Tyranny among them all, as Artfully as was
formerly done by <i>Greece</i>, <i>Rome</i>, and <i>Carthage</i>. Of
their Game, Fish, Rice, Sagu, and other Stores of Fruit and Spice, and
the Royal Mines, we shall speak when the Subject in Hand requires it;
and so of their Weapons, of which last it is to be observ&rsquo;d once
for all, that those they Dart, are all poison&rsquo;d, and the
Fire-Arms differ not from ours. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57"
href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span></p>
<p>For managing of this great Design, the King privately sent about his
Brothers, <span class="marginnote">Pereyra <i>prepares his
Defense</i>.</span> and <i>Sangiacks</i>; but so great an Army could
not be contracted from such distant Parts, without being heard of by
the Christians, and particularly <i>Nunno Pereyra</i>. He suspecting
that the Desire of Revenge still prevail&rsquo;d in the injur&rsquo;d
Parties, and that the first Effects of it would fall upon his Fort,
tho&rsquo; the <i>Sultan&rsquo;s</i> Murderer was not then in it,
strengthned it proportionably to the Siege he expected. Prudence
supplies the Place of Prophesy. The Fort was not then erected, which is
since to be seen in <i>Ternate</i>, on a high Ground of difficult
Ascent, next the Sea, and the Back of it defended by a Lake, next the
Mountain; being three Miles distant from the first Fort: It was
afterwards built to defend themselves against great Fleets; not
satisfy&rsquo;d with that they had before on the Plain, <span class=
"marginnote"><i>The</i> Portuguese <i>Fort</i><span class="corr" id=
"xd21e6659" title="Not in source">.</span></span> next the Sea, made of
dry Stones, without Mortar; which being since improv&rsquo;d in all
Respects, is now built with Lime, the Walls a Yard and half thick, and
Fifteen in Height; Forty in Length next the Sea, with a round Tower at
each Angle, like the ancient <i>Spanish</i> Fortresses. <i>Nunno
Pereyra</i> endeavour&rsquo;d with all possible Diligence, to shut up
in it the greatest Number he could of all the Christian Families, and
to be in a Readiness to stand the Siege, which soon ensu&rsquo;d. He
sent Advice to <i>India</i> and <i>Portugal</i> of the Intelligence he
had receiv&rsquo;d, demanding Succours, as in a certain Danger; but it
could never have come in Time; for some Part of those Forces being
assembled in the Island <i>Ires</i>, the Rest staying on
<i>Botochina</i>, in that Part which is properly call&rsquo;d
<i>Gilolo</i>, and is remote from the <i>Portugueses</i>, they there
began to persecute Christianity by publick Decree.</p>
<p>The Apprehension of these Mischiefs, had much perplex&rsquo;d all
the Governours of those Provinces, because it was daily confirm&rsquo;d
by visible Proofs of an open Insurrection. <i>James Lopez de
Marquita</i> was already kept Prisoner in the Fort of <i>Benastarim</i>
at <i>Goa</i>, those confin&rsquo;d, and the Viceroy expected Orders
from <i>Spain</i> to dispose of him, and the Forces; because it was
fear&rsquo;d the King of <i>Ternate</i> might make use of the great
Supplies which could be sent him from <i>China</i>; especially if that
were certain which was then discoursed in <i>Spain</i>. It was
reported, <span class="marginnote"><i>Project of abandoning the</i>
Philippine <i>Islands</i>.</span> That the Council of State, observing
that the <i>Philippine</i> Islands were rather an Expence, than an
Advantage to the Crown, being many, and hard to be maintain&rsquo;d,
had propos&rsquo;d to King <i>Philip</i>, to quit them, and withdraw
the Court of Justice, and the Garrisons that defend them. They added
the Example of the <i>Chineses</i>, who abandon&rsquo;d them,
tho&rsquo; they are such near Neighbours, and can relieve them with as
much Ease, as if they were joyning to their Continent. That as
<i>Spain</i> governs them, the Loss they occasion is considerable,
without any Hopes that it can ever be alter&rsquo;d for the better; a
vast Quantity of Silver being sent thither from <i>New Spain</i>, both
for the usual Expences, and to buy Commodities; that so all that
Treasure is convey&rsquo;d by the Hands of the <i>Chineses</i> into the
Heart of those Dominions, render&rsquo;d intractable by the Severity of
their Laws, by <span class="marginnote"><i>Reasons for it.</i></span>
which they are trench&rsquo;d in, as it were with Fortification,
against all Commerce with Strangers. They alledg&rsquo;d that a
Monarchy dispers&rsquo;d, and divided by so many Seas, and different
Climates, could scarce be united; nor could humane Wisdom, by settled
Correspondence, tye together Provinces so remov&rsquo;d from one
another by Nature. That these Arguments are not the Ofspring of Wit,
but of Experience, and Truths obvious to the Senses. That all such as
might be urg&rsquo;d against them, were only grounded upon Honour, and
full of a generous Sound, but difficult in the Execution; and therefore
the best Expedient, was for the King to strengthen himself in
<i>Europe</i>, where his Forces can be ready to meet all Dangers,
without being expos&rsquo;d to the Hazards of the Sea, and the
Dominions of others. Each of these Arguments was so fully represented
by the Officers of the Revenue, that the Proposal was thought worthy to
be debated and consider&rsquo;d; and had God permitted the King to
exclude the <i>Philippine</i> Islands his Monarchy, leaving them
expos&rsquo;d to the first that would take Possession, the
<i>Moluccos</i> had so far been strengthen&rsquo;d, as to become
unconquerable.</p>
<p>The same Thing has been propos&rsquo;d at other Times, and in the
Days of King <i>Philip</i> the IIId. who sticking to his Father&rsquo;s
Answer, has always rejected that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58"
href="#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span><span class=
"marginnote"><i>King</i> Philip <i>rejects it</i>.</span> mischievous
Advice. That most prudent Monarch answer&rsquo;d, That the
<i>Philippines</i> should be maintain&rsquo;d, in the same Manner they
were, and the Court should be invested with more Authority, that
Justice might prevail, for he laid the Stress of Government, on its
being upright, and impartially administer&rsquo;d. That in the same
manner the Troops should be kept up there, and maintain&rsquo;d out of
the Revenues of <i>New-Spain</i>, or any other of his Kingdoms, since
all the Treasures discover&rsquo;d, or still hid in the Bowels of the
Mines, ought to be apply&rsquo;d to the Propagation <span class=
"marginnote"><i>His Reasons<span class="corr" id="xd21e6775" title=
"Not in source">.</span></i></span> of the Gospel. For what would the
Enemies of <i>Christ</i> say, if they perceived that the
<i>Philippine</i> Islands were left destitute of the true Light, and
its Ministers to propagate it, because they did not produce rich
Metals, and other Wealth, like the Rest of the fruitful Islands in
<i>Asia</i> and <i>America</i>? That all the Power of Kings, ought to
be subservient to this Sovereign End, as becomes Sons of the Church,
and Promoters of the Apostolical preaching, which is continu&rsquo;d by
Succession. That since he had refused to mitigate the least Point of
his Severity towards his Northern Subjects, or to grant them Liberty of
Conscience; why should he remit any thing among Heathens, and
<i>Mahometans</i>, which were the Harvest God had assign&rsquo;d him,
to enrich the Church with those Children, so remote? Thus the Project
was put down, and this has always been the glorious Resolution, when
mistaken Zeal, or worldly Interests have propos&rsquo;d the quitting of
those Dominions. This seems to have been a peculiar Providence of
Heaven, which knew how soon they were all like to belong to the same
Master, and that the Right and Conquests should be all United in his
Person, the one being the Means to recover the other, as has been seen
in our Days.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Product of</i> Asia.</span> King
<i>Philip</i> was govern&rsquo;d by this Religious Motive; but there
were others urg&rsquo;d by such as were acquainted with the Riches of
<i>Asia</i>, which are chiefly Diamonds, Rubies, large and Seed Pearl,
Amber-Greece, Musk, Civet, Camphir of <i>Borneo</i> and <i>China</i>,
Vermillion, Coral, Quick-Silver, Copper, fine Muslins, and Calicoes of
<i>Cambaya</i> and <i>Bengala</i>, Carpets, Coverlets, and fine Quilts.

"Source: Phsiyck">Physick</span>, Cloves, Mace, Gold, Silver, Medicinal
Plants, Aloes, Eagle Wood, Calamba, Ebony, and very many more rare
Trees, Drugs, Spices, and Ornaments. All this they said, <i>Venice</i>
lost, when the Trade was remov&rsquo;d to <i>Portugal</i>; and this
same stir&rsquo;d up the Sultan of <i>Egypt</i>, as well knowing
therein consisted all substantial Wealth, to enter into a Confederacy
with all the Kings of <i>India</i>; who were already alarm&rsquo;d by
the <i>Portuguese</i> Fleets; so that they at the common charge fitted
out a Navy of Galleys, and other Vessels, in the Port of <i>Suez</i>
furnish&rsquo;d it with Cannon, and put aboard 3000 <i>Mamelucks</i>,
besides a great Number of <i>Venetian</i> and <i>Genoese</i>
Renegadoes. With this Power the Sultan enter&rsquo;d <i>India</i>, in
the Year 1508, and tho&rsquo; the King of <i>Cambaya</i> assisted him,
he was vanquish&rsquo;d by the <i>Portugueses</i> in the Port of
<i>Chaul</i>. They urg&rsquo;d, That at present these Riches are still
more valuable, and that if the Trade of them were once brought into the
Way of the <i>Philippine</i> Islands, it would save all the Dangers met
with, by the way of <i>Amboyna</i>, <i>Banda</i>, <i>Borneo</i>, and
the many Shoals about them, as also the many Storms those narrow Seas
are subject to. For the Clove particularly was brought by the
<i>Portugueses</i>, in their Trading Galeon, which goes from <i>Goa</i>
to the <i>Moluccos</i>, to pay their Garrisons. In this Ship they every
year carry&rsquo;d away to <i>Malaca</i> and <i>Goa</i>, 24000
<i>Quintals</i>, or Hundred Weight of Cloves, little more or less. At
those Ports it was dealt to <i>Persians</i>, <i>Turks</i>,
<i>Chineses</i>, and <i>Africans</i>, so that scarce the third Part
came to <i>Europe</i>. The King of <i>Achem</i>, in <i>Sumatra</i>,
secur&rsquo;d another Part, whence it was sent to <i>Alexandria</i>.
All these Commodities, when they come to <i>Malaca</i>, pay eight
<i>per Cent.</i> The Spice that comes into <i>Spain</i> is distributed
into all the Kingdoms of <i>Europe</i>; and it might be easily
contriv&rsquo;d, say these People, to bring the greatest Part to
<i>Spain</i> from the <i>Philippine</i> Islands; which would be one of
the noblest Projects, that will be thought of for the improving of the
Revenue, considering what a great Price Clove bears in <i>Spain</i>,
and how cheap it is in the <i>Molucco</i>. This was the Opinion when
those Islands belong&rsquo;d to another Master, and it was no easie
Matter to divert the Trade of Spice, and other Goods, from the usual
<i>India</i> Voyage. Besides the Religious Men of the Orders of St.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span><i>Augustin</i> and St. <i>Dominick</i>, had
already propagated the Faith in those and other Islands, whence that
which flourish&rsquo;d, and advanc&rsquo;d in <i>Ternate</i> and
<i>Tydore</i> was Fed.</p>
<p><i>Cachil Babu</i> sail&rsquo;d with his Brothers, and a great
Number of Vessels from <i>Ires</i> for <i>Ternate</i>, with much Joy,
and forebodings of Victory; greater Forces continually joyning him,
through the earnest Desire they had all of delivering those Parts from
the <i>Portuguese</i> Domination. As soon as ever they arriv&rsquo;d at
<i>Ternate</i>, they landed, and immediately invested the Fort, which
they call&rsquo;d the <i>Seat of Servitude</i>. <span class=
"marginnote">Portuguese <i>Fort besieg&rsquo;d</i>.</span> They
assaulted the Houses of the <i>Portugueses</i>, and that so suddenly,
that though they had Notice before, and lived in Fear, they scarce
stood upon their Defence. Rage and Success made a more than Barbarous
Havock. They set Fire to the Houses with Fury, and popular Tumult; so
that whatsoever was not within a Wall and Ditch, perish&rsquo;d that
Day. Those in the Fort attempted to succour their People; but greater
Numbers of <i>Ternates</i> coming on, kill&rsquo;d some of those, who
had sally&rsquo;d out, not only with Darts of solid Canes, which they
cast most dexteriously, with Arrows, Cymiters and Shields, which they
us&rsquo;d when Idolaters; but with Muskets and other Fire Arms. The
rest of the <i>Portugueses</i> routed, fled to their Fort; for those
who had gain&rsquo;d Reputation by so many brave Exploits, were that
Day depriv&rsquo;d of their Courage, by the Injustice of the Action
they had been concern&rsquo;d in. They sent again to <i>Goa</i> to
desire Relief, and to represent the <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Desolation.</i></span> Distress, not only of the Fort
of <i>Ternate</i>, but of all the others the King of <i>Portugal</i>
held in those Eastern Parts; for they had cast off Subjection to him in
most of them. They forgot not to mention the persecution of the
Religion, and the scarcity of Arms and Provisions, of both which the
<i>Ternates</i> had deprived them. These News were flown into
<i>India</i> and <i>Spain</i> by other Ways; and all the while the
Siege lasted <i>Goa</i> sent Succours to the <i>Moluccos</i>, in their
trading Galeons; but <span class="marginnote">Tydore <i>and</i> Ternate
<i>mortal Enemies</i>.</span> the vast Distance, the many Shoals, and
the violent Storms those Seas are subject to, occasion&rsquo;d the Loss
of those Ships, or put them by their intended Voyage.</p>
<p>The Commanders in those Eastern Ports, who follow&rsquo;d the
Example of those of <i>Ternate</i> were not Idle; for the
<i>Portuguese</i>, tho&rsquo; the reducing of those Rebels succeeded
not at that Time, did not miss of obtaining other Victories, which
should we relate them here, would make this look more like a History of
all <i>India</i> than of one small part of it; besides that the
<i>Portugueses</i> Nation has not wanted Learned Authors, who have
transmitted them to us, where they may be seen at large. The
<i>Spaniards</i> have also done the like, in a much more loftier Stile
than mine. We must therefore circumscribe our selves, and return to the
<i>Moluccos</i>, where the Besieged, as it were forsaken, and
abandon&rsquo;d by all the Earth, endure the Hardships and Perils of
Places so streightned.</p>
<p>Thus all their Hopes, under Heaven, depended on their own Valour,
and the inviolable Friendship of the King of <i>Tydore</i>, so
implacable an Enemy to him of <i>Ternate</i>, that neither the
Neighbourhood of the Kingdoms, divided only by an Arm of the Sea, a
League and half over, in the midst whereof is a small Desart Island,
which almost joyns them, nor the ancient and reiterated Alliances, do
in the least abate of their Hatred, which seems to be fatal, and
consequently unavoidable betwixt those two Kings and Nations.</p>
<p>However, the <i>Ternates</i> being always intent upon War, and
thinking no Practice <span class="marginnote"><i>Practices of</i> Babu
<i>with</i> Tydore.</span> unlawful, that may secure their Success,
they ply&rsquo;d their Weapons on one Hand, and on the Other,
carry&rsquo;d on their Intrigues, for a Pacification with the King of
<i>Tydore</i>; not so much out of any Desire of coming to a Conclusion
with him, as to the End that being amaz&rsquo;d with the Hopes of
Peace, he might grow slack in Relieving and Assisting the Besieged.
They offer&rsquo;d to restore him some Places, taken from him during
the late Wars; and to give him those and others, as a Portion with a
Daughter to the King of <i>Ternate</i>; besides other Advantages, of
which Accommodation the King of <i>Bachian</i> was the chief Manager.
To these fair Offers, they added Threats; and both the Kings and their
Nations agreeing in Religion, and it being easy to cover any Occasion
of War under fair Pretences; it happen&rsquo;d that the <i>Tydores</i>,
at least while this Politick Game was playing, did not afford their
Succours with the same Zeal as they had done at first; and that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name=
"pb60">60</a>]</span>King, who till then had been a constant Friend,
upon another Consideration, deferr&rsquo;d <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Policy of the K. of</i> Tydore.</span> his coming to a
Resolution. He waited, as well as the Besieged, the Arrival of the
<i>Portuguese</i> Succours, and several of his <i>Carcoas</i> often
touch&rsquo;d at the Islands of <i>Borneo</i>, to enquire what Ships
pass&rsquo;d that Way from <i>India</i>. They examin&rsquo;d every
Vessel they met, and every slight Intelligence puff&rsquo;d them up, or
quite cast them down. In short, both Parties protracted the Time, with
so little Regard to any other Principles, that all their Courage and
Fidelity, depended on it alone.</p>
<p>This is so certain, that the King of <i>Tydore</i> being just at the
Point of accepting the Wife, and Lands offer&rsquo;d him by the Enemy,
fell off upon the News brought him, that a Galleon was seen sailing for
the <i>Molucco</i> Islands, and he rejected all the Proposals. It was
afterwards known to be bound for the <i>Philippine</i> Islands, and
belong&rsquo;d neither to the <i>Portuguese</i> nor <i>Spaniards</i>;
but to <i>Venetian</i> Merchants, who traded between <i>Manila</i> and
<i>China</i>, with several Commodities of their own Country, and other
Parts of the <i>Levant</i>; so that the King of <i>Tydore</i>, and the
Besieged themselves began to make fresh Reparations, like Men that
sharpen their Weapons, and fit their Armour.</p>
<p>These Succours encourag&rsquo;d them to several bold Attempts. The
Besieged made <span class="marginnote"><i>Sallies, and the Length of
the Siege.</i></span> a Salley, to nail up the Enemies Cannon, and
tho&rsquo; few in Number, several Times assaulted their Camp, still
returning Victorious, without any considerable Loss. They dismounted
all their Cannon from the Walls, their Works nothing availing them,
because they were not made according to Art. The Siege lasted five
Years, the <i>Portugueses</i> sustaining it with notable Resolution,
and the <i>Indians</i> pressing with no less Obstinacy; nor would the
Hunger, Thurst, Nakedness, and the Hardships of the Seasons have been
tollerable, had not they been common to both Parties. Extream Want, was
the Occasion of several signal Exploits of that Valour, wherewith they
defended their Lives, and the Fort. This produc&rsquo;d Rage and
Admiration in the Enemy; and an affectionate Compassion in the Women of
the Island; among whom they found Advice, Secrecy, Intelligence and
known Favour. So great is the Power of Persecuted Virtue, that it
prevails, even upon those Enemies, who harbour the Memory of a Wrong,
to convert it, first into a Desire of forgetting it, and without long
Interposition of Time, produces a Zeal to support that Valour they
first hated.</p>

Arms.</i></span> Both Sides now took the Breathing of a short
Cessation; advantagious to <i>Ternate</i> for the Liberty of Trade, and
to the <i>Portugueses</i>, because it gain&rsquo;d Time to their Hope
of Relief, which they concluded must be near at Hand, by Reason it had
been long expected. They were not discouraged by Events, those having
prov&rsquo;d alternatively Successful and Unfortunate, and Victory was
toss&rsquo;d to and fro; besides that the Interruption of Commerce had
knit some the closer together in Friendship. I could mention several
Instances of this Sort, contain&rsquo;d in Letters, and other
<i>Spanish</i> and <i>Portuguese</i> Relations, sent by Religious Men
from the <i>Moluccos</i>, to the Governours of the <i>Philippine</i>
Islands, whose Papers have, upon this Occasion, been lay&rsquo;d before
me, for my better Information, for which Reason we may make Use of some
of them, without departing from the main Subject. The gravest of the
<i>Greek</i> and <i>Latin</i> Historians sometimes intermix private
Adventures, as it were short Episodes to divert the Reader. The Example
of great Masters is a sufficient Authority for Learners, for which
Reason I may well be allow&rsquo;d this Freedom.</p>
<p>One <i>Duarte</i>, a brave Ensign, had contracted strict Friendship
with <i>Cachil</i> <span class="marginnote"><i>A Love Story.</i></span>
<i>Tudura</i>, which was no way obstructed by the Difficulties of the
Seige, nor so much as interrupted. <i>Duarte</i> was wont in the dead
of the Night, to go safely into the City in the Habit of the Country,
and by the Help of the Language, being Master of it, where he was
privately admitted into his Friend&rsquo;s House, and well
receiv&rsquo;d there on another Account by <i>Tudurisa</i>,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>his only Daughter, who, being prevail&rsquo;d on
by the Love she bore <i>Duarte</i>, imbrac&rsquo;d the Christian
Religion. The Father was not unacquainted with their Love, but he also
knew that it was attended by Modesty in <i>Tudurisa</i>, and true
Courtesy in <i>Duarte</i>. Returning to the Fort, he used to be taken
in the same dangerous way, by those Persons who had let him down with a
Rope. He brought with him some Intelligence and Provisions; but he came
not so entire himself, for the <i>Indian</i> Woman, who was to be his
Wife, had robb&rsquo;d him of his Heart. <i>Nuno Pereyra</i> going the
Rounds miss&rsquo;d the Ensign at his Post, and enquiring into it,
understood the Cause of his Absence; in Respect to which, considering
the mighty Power it often has over great Souls, he conniv&rsquo;d at
the Breach of Martial Discipline, assigning that to the Passion,
without reproving the Lover. Whether he follow&rsquo;d the Example we
read of <i>Quintus Fabius Maximus</i>, in the like Case, or on Account
that Experience shows, there is Nothing can hold a Lover so fast as the
Presence of the lov&rsquo;d Object; <i>Pereyra</i> enjoining all
Persons to keep the Secret, contriv&rsquo;d, without offending
<i>Tudura</i>, that his Daughter should come privately into the Fort,
which she consented to, without many Perswasions. Having so done, the
Commander in Chief, calling his Ensign, said to him, <i>I am
inform&rsquo;d, that at certain Times, and that when the Danger is
greatest, you forsake us; but that it is not for want of Affection, or
not knowing the Duty of your Post; tho&rsquo; we were not
confin&rsquo;d to these narrow Walls, I would not punish your Failure,
because Mildness has ever been more efficacious for correcting of
Generous Souls, than Rigour. It will not be convenient for the Future,
that we be left without you, and in Fear for what may befall you: Here
is your Wife</i>, and then she appear&rsquo;d, <i>brought hither
without any Force, or Opposition from her Father. Take her to you
lovingly, and do not suffer the Honour of</i> Portugal, <i>depending on
these few Men, to want the Bravery of so able an Officer</i>.
<i>Duarte</i> was amaz&rsquo;d, generously out of Countenance, full of
Love, and knew not what to say; but was excus&rsquo;d by his Friends,
and even by <i>Nunno Pereyra</i>.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Hopes and Despair of the
Besieged.</i></span> It was now the Year 1575, when the Besieged began
to conceive some Hopes of their Deliverance; because the
<i>Saugiacks</i> and <i>Cachils</i> of the King of
<i>Ternate&rsquo;s</i> Race were divided into Factions, and there
wanted not some among them, who endeavour&rsquo;d to draw the
<i>Portugueses</i> over to their Party. These Misunderstandings made
them act less vigorously; and did not they look on theirs as the Common
Cause, the Design had succeeded. The <i>Portugueses</i> in this
Condition, despairing of all Relief, the Natives of <i>Ternate</i> on
the other Side of the Island, next those of the <i>Meaos</i>,
discover&rsquo;d a Galeon coming from <i>Malaca</i>, having coasted
about <i>Borneo</i>; they concluded it was that which brought the
Succours from <i>Portugal</i>, and being assur&rsquo;d it was so, they
became unanimous again, and press&rsquo;d on the Seige; but Force
little prevailing against the Resolution of <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Proposals of Accommodation, and Reasons for
it.</i></span> the Besieged, <i>Cachil Tulo</i>, by Permission,
propos&rsquo;d some Terms, which the Commander in Chief had long
listen&rsquo;d to from the Wall. One Day making several Overtures,
<i>Tulo</i> told him, That the King, his Brother, was willing to put an
End to that tedious Seige, upon any Conditions. That to this Effect had
concluded a Peace with the King of <i>Tydore</i>, that he might not
relieve them for the Future. That the King of <i>Bachian</i> had
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=
"pb63">63</a>]</span>joyn&rsquo;d him for the same Purpose; to the End,
that since they were all convinc&rsquo;d that was their common Cause,
they might with their joynt Power make their utmost Efforts. That the
Cessation which had lasted till then, tho&rsquo; advantages to the
King, as encouraging the Trade with the <i>Javaneses</i>, and
<i>Rumes</i>, who came to Load Clove, must of Necessity cease. He
ask&rsquo;d how long they would expose their Lives to the utmost
Dangers, only to gain an empty Name of <i>Loyal Subjects</i>, which,
perhaps, would never be known to him that was to reward it. He bid them
consider the Villany of his Father, King <i>Aerio&rsquo;s</i> Death,
and that by their Obstinate holding out they made the Murderers Cause
more Criminal. That they thus show&rsquo;d they approv&rsquo;d of
anothers Treachery, whose Punishment they would compass by other Means.
That they ought to be very thankfull, that the King would not involve
them in the Guilt of that Wretch, who contrary to his solemn Oath, to
the Laws of Friendship, and the Honour of the <i>Portuguese</i> Nation,
or rather to Nature it self, had Murder&rsquo;d that King, who most
inviolably observ&rsquo;d the Faith he had engag&rsquo;d to him.
Besides, that they were sensible how little Comfort uncertain Hopes
could afford amidst real Wants; and how impracticable it was for Relief
to come from so great a distance, through such boisterous Seas, causing
so many Shipwrecks, and which seem&rsquo;d to have conspir&rsquo;d
against those who had oppress&rsquo;d and injur&rsquo;d
<i>Ternate</i>.</p>
<p>He concluded his Discourse requiring the Commander in Chief, to
deliver up the Fort, or expect the utmost Rigour; for if he once
refus&rsquo;d the Terms offer&rsquo;d, and provok&rsquo;d them, they
would spare neither Sex, nor Age. The Besieg&rsquo;d were not free from
Jealousie, that there was Fraud in these Offers; <span class=
"marginnote"><i>The Besieged Surrender.</i></span> yet, perceiving that
the Succours never came from <i>India</i>, either because retarded by
the <i>African</i> War, in which King <i>Sebastian</i> had
engag&rsquo;d himself, or by the Difficulties of that dangerous Voyage;
and believing that the two Kings of <i>Tydore</i> and <i>Ternate</i>
were reconcil&rsquo;d, as <i>Tulo</i> told them, thinking he of
<i>Tydore</i>, without whose support they could not subsist, had
forsaken their Friendship, the Proposals were accepted by unanimous
Consent, after <i>Nuno Pereyra</i> had return&rsquo;d a resolute
Answer, suitable to that Part of <i>Cachil Tulo&rsquo;s</i> Words,
which contain&rsquo;d any Threats, signifying to him, how little they
mov&rsquo;d himself, or his Men; and that he would hearken to no
Conditions to the disservice of his God, or his King, or to disparage
the Bravery of his Soldiers, which had been so often try&rsquo;d to the
cost of the Natives of <i>Ternate</i>; nevertheless upon some other
Considerations, he would <span class="marginnote"><i>The
Capitulation.</i></span> surrender the Fort, provided that all the
<i>Portugueses</i> might march out in a Body, Colours Flying, with
their Wives, Children, Slaves, and all their Goods, having first
Hostages given them to their content, that no Harm, or Injury should be
done them. That the King should secure them their Passage to
<i>Amboyna</i>, and find them Vessels; and that such as should happen
to be left in Dominions for want of them, should have no Ransome
demanded of them, either then, or at the time of their departure. That
the Fort and Guns should be deliver&rsquo;d to King <i>Babu</i>, upon
express Condition, That he should hold it for the King of
<i>Portugal</i>, and in his Name, to whom he should restore it,
whensoever he effectually punish&rsquo;d the Murder of King
<i>Aerio</i>. The King easily Granted, and Swore to perform all those
Conditions, being eager to possess himself of the Fort, before the
Succours arriv&rsquo;d, <span class="marginnote"><i>The Fort
Deliver&rsquo;d.</i></span> which were now near at hand. On the Day
appointed, which was Saint <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href=
"#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span><i>Stephen&rsquo;s</i>, the
<i>Ternates</i> took up all the advantageous Posts to view the
<i>Portugueses</i>, who march&rsquo;d out as if they had been
Conquerors; and no sooner were they out of the Fort, than the Natives
running in, possess&rsquo;d themselves of the Guns, with loud Laughter
and Shouts, Scoffing at those that left it; for the third Day after the
Galeon arriv&rsquo;d, well Mann&rsquo;d, and furnish&rsquo;d with Guns,
and all Necessaries, and <i>James de Azambuja</i> in it, as Commander
in Chief. They had thoughts of Recovering the Fort, but it was too
late, because the Enemy was possess&rsquo;d of all Things, without any
Opposition. <i>Pereyra</i> then perceiv&rsquo;d how great an Obstacle
Precipitation is to the chusing of the safest Advice, and how
infallibly it is follow&rsquo;d by fruitless Repentance; since had he
delay&rsquo;d but never so little longer, tho&rsquo; it were only to
weigh the Enemies Proposals, who ought never to be suppos&rsquo;d
Sincere, he might have sav&rsquo;d himself and Destroy&rsquo;d them.
For this Reason, tho&rsquo; he wanted not an honourable Excuse, he
resolv&rsquo;d not to return to <i>Goa</i>, having private Intelligence
that the Viceroy would not fail to secure him, in Order to cut off his
Head. <i>Azambuja</i> protected him in his Galeon, and he went over
with many others to <i>Amboyna</i>. The rest spread themselves
throughout the Neighbouring Islands, in Vessels they begg&rsquo;d. Some
return&rsquo;d to <i>Malaca</i>, and only sixteen <i>Portuguese</i>
Families remain&rsquo;d in <i>Ternate</i> for want of Shipping; who at
first submitted to the change of their Fortune: but could not
afterwards comply with the Difference there is betwixt Domination and
Servitude. The King of <i>Tydore</i> a <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Portugueses</i> settle at <i>Tydore</i>.</span> most
trusty Friend to the <i>Spaniards</i> in their greatest Affliction,
offer&rsquo;d them his Islands, Houses, and Trade of Spice. He sent
them a good Number of <i>Carcoas</i>, which carry&rsquo;d them over to
his Dominions, and soon after assign&rsquo;d them a convenient Place to
build their Houses and Churches. This Colony was increased, and the
Number of its Inhabitants augmented by <i>Sancho de Vasconselos</i>,
who sent others from <i>Malaca</i>, being Commander in Chief of
<i>Goa</i> and afterwards of <i>Amboyna</i>, in the Year 1578. At last
he came thither himself, and erected a Fort, a quarter of a League from
the City of <i>Tydore</i>, which gives its Name to the Island.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Tydore</i> describ&rsquo;d.</span>
<i>Tydore</i>, in the Language of those Parts, which was formerly
spoken, signifies, Fertility and Beauty. <i>Europeans</i> generally
give it this Name; but its King, as appears by his <i>Arabick</i> and
<i>Persian</i> Subscriptions, Writes <i>Tudura</i>, and not
<i>Tydore</i>. It is not inferior to <i>Ternate</i> for Fruitfulness,
and Delight, but far exceeds it in Magnitude and Populousness; and
yields the same Aromatick Product. Curious Persons have there
try&rsquo;d to improve the Clove, watering and pruning the Tree at
proper Seasons, and it appears to embrace the Helps of Art, by growing
bigger, more active in its Vertue, and the Scent stronger. The white
Sanders here come to more Perfection, than in any other of the Eastern
Parts. In this, as well as the other <i>Molucco</i> Islands are found
those Birds, they, in their Language, call <span class=
"marginnote">Birds of Paradice.</span> <i>Manucodiatas</i>, signifying
Birds of Paradise, from a Fable, credited by those superstitious
People, that they came down from Heaven. The Fort here was afterwards
enlarg&rsquo;d by <i>Nuno Pereyra</i>, not far from the Port, and then
by <i>James de Azambuja</i>. The latter did not only contribute with
his Industry, <span class="marginnote">Fort of <i>Tydore</i>.</span>
but with his Labour, carrying the Materials himself, when it was
requisite to set the Soldiers an Example, and forward the Work; which
the King often view&rsquo;d, and was well pleas&rsquo;d to see the
Fortifications. He <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65"
name="pb65">65</a>]</span>discours&rsquo;d familiarly with the
Officers, advis&rsquo;d with them in his Wars, and comforted the
Christians, and they far&rsquo;d best, for from that Time forward,
there being none in <i>Ternate</i>, and that Fort in the Hands of the
Natives, the Heathens and <i>Mahometans</i> seem&rsquo;d to be Superior
and Conquerors throughout all those Provinces. They strengthen&rsquo;d
themselves with Works and other Preparations, erected Forts on high
Places, and bending their Minds against the Christians, put many to
cruel Martyrdoms; that so the Foundation of our Faith may be in all
Parts cemented with the Blood of the Faithful. They dismember&rsquo;d
the Bodies, and burnt the Legs <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Persecution.</i></span> and Arms in the sight of the
still Living Trunks. They impal&rsquo;d the Women, tore out their
Bowels, and they surving themselves, beheld their still moving Flesh in
the Hands of their Executioners. Children were pull&rsquo;d Piecemeal
before their Mothers Eyes, and Infants still in Embrio were rent from
their Wombs. It has been made out, that above 60000 Christians fell by
the Sword in only the King of <i>Ternate</i>&rsquo;s Dominions. This is
asserted in the Annual Relations of the Fathers of the Society, who
preach&rsquo;d in those Parts. They give an Account of this dismal
Persecution, with all the Circumstances of the Cruelties; as how the
persecuted Persons fled to the Mountains, seeking for Compassion among
the wild Beasts, others cast themselves into the Sea, where they
perish&rsquo;d, either devour&rsquo;d by its Monsters, or
swallow&rsquo;d by the Waves themselves, not being able to reach the
other Islands. A considerable Number of these religious Fugitives, as
they swam met a <i>Portuguese</i> Ship, coming to the Relief of those
at <i>Amboyna</i>, and with dismal Voices cry&rsquo;d out, <i>Help,
Relieve us, for we are Christians</i>. They carefully took them up in
their Boats, and having view&rsquo;d them at Leasure, found that none
of them were above 12 Years of Age. Yet at this same Time, when cruelty
advanc&rsquo;d God&rsquo;s Glory, Providence seem&rsquo;d to act
Counter in the very Cities, and Deserts. Idolaters and
<i>Mahometans</i> were converted, and our Religious Men preach&rsquo;d
and catechis&rsquo;d, without any Fear of Punishment, which they rather
coveted, and thought themselves unworthy of it; encouraging one another
with the Examples the Tyrant made, for several Purposes. But all those
People looking upon it as their Duty to seek Revenge, their Cruelty
gaining Applause under that Name, and <i>Europe</i> being
involv&rsquo;d in Dismal Troubles, they met with no Opposition in the
Execution of their Vengeance, and the Calamity ran so high, that in the
space of thirty Years, they either quite obliterated, or much obscured
the Name of Christianity in those Eastern Parts, destroy&rsquo;d our
Churches, and, like those who prepare to hunt wild Beasts, arm&rsquo;d
themselves against the Faithful who liv&rsquo;d in more security among
those savage Creatures, or in Deserts never penetrated by Men, feeding
on Herbs, and gaining Time, by that lawful Retreat for the sake of the
Gospel, for the Wrath of Heav&rsquo;n, whose Executioners those Men
were, to pass over. Above 36 Towns, of each 800 Inhabitants in
<i>Gilolo</i> and <i>Celebes</i> a spacious and populous Country, and
in those of the two Kings of <i>Sian</i> and <i>Sanguil</i>,
<span class="marginnote"><i>Many Apostatize.</i></span> who
profess&rsquo;d Christianity, with most of their Subjects, in the
Kingdom of <i>Cauripana</i>; in that of <i>Bachian</i>, whose King and
his People were Sons of the Church; in the Islands of <i>Amboyna</i>,
where Forty Towns worshipped CHRIST, in the Bosom of his Faith, and in
those of <i>Tydore</i>, which were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66"
href="#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>not without this Light; in all
those Places they fell off from Christianity, and were utterly lost;
first through the Insolency of the <i>Portuguese</i> Commanders, and
lastly on Account of the Death of <i>Sultan Aerio</i>; who, as was
prov&rsquo;d, had given no real, nor so much as a likely Token of
Falshood, for which they might be provok&rsquo;d to destroy him.
However the Christians dy&rsquo;d with such Resolution, that the
Persecuters took not away any Life but what became a fresh Example of
Magnanimity, and perhaps Providence might permit that Accident of
<i>Aerio</i>, with a Design to advance the Churches Glory.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Augustin Nunez <i>sent to Command at</i>
Amboyna.</span> <i>Sultan Babu</i> making his present Victory an
Instrument to obtain others, Ship&rsquo;d his Men, in Order to besiege
<i>Tydore</i> and <i>Bachian</i>; and tho&rsquo; he met with a vigorous
Defence in both Places, and the <i>Portuguese</i> Auxiliaries made some
Amends for his Superiority of Power, yet they submitted to the Tyrant.
This Revenge made him stick at no Cruelty. In <i>November</i>, this
same Year, a Galeon came to <i>Malaca</i> from <i>India</i>, to carry
Succours for the <i>Moluccos</i>, commanded by Captain <i>Augustin
Nunez</i>, the Eldest and Bravest Commander in those Days, as he made
it appear in the Expedition of <i>Chaul</i>, when it was besieged by
<i>Niza Molucco</i>, when <i>Don Luys de Atayde</i> was Viceroy of
<i>India</i>, in the year 1578. The Galeon was stor&rsquo;d with all
Necessaries, and in it <i>James</i> <span class="marginnote">James
Lopez de Mezquita <i>sent Prisoner to</i> Ternate.</span> <i>Lopez de
Mezquita</i>, the Murderer of <i>Aerio</i>, design&rsquo;d for
Punishment, in Satisfaction for the Wrong done. He was so strong, and
fierce, that to secure him, he was fetter&rsquo;d with a great Chain,
the End whereof was made fast to a heavy Piece of Brass Cannon.
<i>Augustin Nunez</i> had Orders to convey him to the new King of
<i>Ternate</i>, to be deliver&rsquo;d to him bolted, like a Criminal,
that he might pass such a sentence of Death on him as he thought fit,
which should be executed in his Presence, pursuant to the Orders sent
by the King of <i>Portugal</i>. They put him on double Fetters,
Manacles, and Chains, and kept him in the Steeridge. <i>Augustin
Nunez</i> went to succeed <i>Sancho de Vasconcelos</i>, in the Fort of
<i>Amboyna</i>; but a storm rising, he was forc&rsquo;d into the Port
of <i>Japara</i>, of <i>Sunda</i>, in the greater <i>Java</i>. The
Galeon wanting water, and Refreshment, he there sent for it; which the
Native <i>Javaneses</i> brought him in 40 Vessels. Among them came 150
Soldiers in the Habit of Peasants, and Fishermen; who making many words
as is usual among Buyers and Sellers, drew the Ponyards they brought
conceal&rsquo;d, and surprizing the <i>Portugueses</i>, fell on with
such Fury and Cruelty, that they <span class="marginnote"><i>The
Murderer kill&rsquo;d.</i></span> kill&rsquo;d them all. Among them
dy&rsquo;d <i>James Lopez de Mezquita</i>, but fighting with
extraordinary Bravery, tho&rsquo; held by his Chain, hinder&rsquo;d by
his Fetters, and other heavy Encumbrances, and restrain&rsquo;d by the
Cannon, to which his Chain was made fast. However he got a Sword and a
Buckler wherewith he cut down ten <i>Javaneses</i>, revenging on them
the Death of the <i>Portugueses</i>, and they on him, that of King
<i>Aerio</i> of <i>Ternate</i>, which had occasion&rsquo;d so much
Slaughter. Seventy three Christians were kill&rsquo;d and above the
same Number of <i>Javaneses</i>, and their Vessels had been taken, but
that others came to their Assistance from the Shore in the Heat of the
Action, in which there were Men with Fire-Locks and Lances, six Yards
and a Quarter long, the Points of them poison&rsquo;d. The Galeon was
taken without any Succour, nor was the Cannon of any Use.</p>
<p>It is but reasonable that so manly and honourable a Death should, as
is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=
"pb67">67</a>]</span>usual, render all this Gentlemans Life honourable;
and that his Fetters, and Sufferings joyn&rsquo;d to it, excite
Compassion and Affection in the minds of the <span class=
"marginnote"><i>His Vindication.</i></span> Readers, so to blot out the
Hatred they have conceiv&rsquo;d against him on Account of <i>Sultan
Aerio&rsquo;s</i> Death. It is to be observ&rsquo;d, for his
justification that it does not appear, not is it reported, he was
incens&rsquo;d to perform that Act through Interest, Ambition, or any
other private Motives; but was mov&rsquo;d to it by Informations which
perswaded him it was convenient, for the Establishing and Advancement
of Religion, and the publick Peace. Very brave men must also be
allow&rsquo;d some Excesses of Fierceness, which proceed from an
extraordinary Force in the irascible Part of the mind, and wherein
Valour is subdu&rsquo;d. When these Persons find themselves
encompass&rsquo;d by great Numbers, and streightned by wrongful
Violence; if they are not to be daunted and overcome, it comes to pass
that Patience often provok&rsquo;d turns that Courage into Fury and
Rage, which causes them to make mighty Slaughters, and Examples of
Cruelty; led to it not only by Passion, but also by Judgment and
Thought, which directs them to cause themselves to be dreaded even to
Astonishment, to save themselves and their People from other great
Cruelties which usually mean Souls attempt and practice upon those they
stand much in Fear of. Let this Reflection serve for a general Excuse
to other Offences of this sort mention&rsquo;d, or blam&rsquo;d in our
History.</p>
<p>This Accident, in as much as related to the Death of <i>James Lopez
de Mezquita</i>, was forgot, or at least not known for many Years, for
in 1603 the King of <i>Ternate</i> demanded Justice of our King,
against that Man not knowing that God had summon&rsquo;d him before a
more upright Tribunal. The News being brought to <i>Malaca</i>, the
Commander <i>Arias de Saldana</i> immediately <span class=
"marginnote">Peter Lopez de Sousa <i>sent to</i> Moluccos.</span> sent
away another Galeon, he call&rsquo;d <i>S. Peter</i> and <i>S.
Paul</i>, for the <i>Moluccos</i> under command of <i>Peter Lopez de
Sousa</i>, and a Galley with 150 Soldiers to relieve <i>Sancho de
Vasconcelos</i> at <i>Amboyna</i>, where he wanted Provisions, and was
streightned. They <span class="corr" id="xd21e7807" title=
"Source: saild">sail&rsquo;d</span> in May 1579, to touch at
<i>Borneo</i>, there to take in all Necessaries for the Design. He
arriv&rsquo;d on that Island in <i>June</i>, and found it in an Uproar,
occasion&rsquo;d by the <i>Spaniards</i> <span class=
"marginnote">Spaniards <i>at</i> Borneo.</span> who came thither with
Doctor <i>Sandi</i>, Governour of the <i>Philippine</i> Islands in 30
rowing Vessels. He took the City, and put the King to flight, who was a
Lover of the <i>Portugueses</i>, and from that time <i>Manila</i> began
to be look&rsquo;d upon as a place of Arms, for the recovering of the
<i>Molucco Islands</i>; and if <i>Sandi</i> had then employ&rsquo;d
those, he carry&rsquo;d to this other Expedition against them, he would
have found the Tyrant less settled, and consequently his Revenge more
easy. <i>Vasconcelos</i> died at <i>Amboyna</i>, and <i>James de
Azambuja</i> succeeded him, so that nothing came now from <i>India</i>
but fair Promises. In the <i>Philippine</i> Islands they had no Orders
at that Time to intermeddle in those Wars, because they then
belong&rsquo;d to another Sovereign, and therefore they were only
Lookers on to those Martyrdoms, and Revolutions and employ&rsquo;d
themselves as they us&rsquo;d in <i>Camboxa</i>, <i>Mindanao</i>,
<i>Japan</i> and <i>China</i>, and then particularly in <i>Borneo</i>,
without regarding those other Successes.</p>
<p><i>Borneo</i> lies between <i>Malaca</i> and the <i>Moluccos</i>,
and according to the Opinion <span class="marginnote">Borneo
<i>describ&rsquo;d</i>.</span> of <i>Gerard Mercator</i>, is that which
<i>Ptolomy</i> calls, the Island of Good Fortune. A Point of it lies
under the Equinoctial, and the greater Part stretches out to 6 Degrees
of North Latitude, taking up the two first Parallels. Thus it appears
to be above 400 Leagues in Compass. It abounds <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span>in
Provisions, and all other Necessaries for the Support of humane Life.
And produces abundance of Camphire, Agarick Diamonds, vast Numbers of
Horses, smaller than the <i>Spanish</i>; but it has not such plenty of
Sheep, or Kine: There is a general Resort of Trade in all its Populous
Cities and Ports. The Capital is <i>Borneo</i>, which gives Name to the
Island, built on a Spacious Lake the Sea Forms, like <i>Venice</i>, and
said to contain 23000 Houses: The King is a <i>Mahometan</i>; no man
speaks to him but by the Interposition of an Interpreter. The Natives
worship Idols. They are White, good Natur&rsquo;d and sharp Witted.
They have no certain Fashion of Cloaths. Many of them wear Cotton
Shirts, and others of white common single Tabby, with red Lists.</p>
<p><i>Sirelela</i>, Brother to this King, came to <i>Manila</i>, where
Doctor <i>Sandi</i> being then Governour, he laid before him his
Pretensions, and some Means he had for bringing his Designs to bear;
but he put the main Stress upon <span class="marginnote"><i>King of</i>
Borneo&rsquo;<i>s Brothers at</i> Manila.</span> his having a greater
Party there, than the King his Brother. He promised which would be no
difficult Matter, in Regard of the Hatred the People bore the King,
that he would make the Kingdom Tributary to the Kings of <i>Spain</i>.
The Governour having taken sufficient Precautions, condescended to his
Request, and arming as many <i>Spaniards</i>, and <i>Philippines</i> as
he thought convenient, with all Necessaries for a great Enterprize,
ship&rsquo;d them, and arriv&rsquo;d happily at <i>Borneo</i>. He
attack&rsquo;d it in several Places; the best of the People immediately
declar&rsquo;d for the Brother. The King thinking himself weakest at
Sea, reserv&rsquo;d his Forces for the Land, and being deceiv&rsquo;d
<span class="marginnote">Spaniards <i>overthrow that King</i>.</span>
in his Expectation, was forc&rsquo;d to fly, his Army being routed,
without any Remains to attend him in the Deserts, and Retreats of the
Mountains, where he liv&rsquo;d miserably. <i>Sirelela</i> ascended the
Throne; the Victorious <i>Spaniards</i> return&rsquo;d to the
<i>Philippine</i> Islands loaded with Booty; and among other Things, if
we may believe Relations, brought 600 Pieces of Artillery. However the
depos&rsquo;d King, a few Months after, got to a Head again. No Man
ought to Despair in Adversity, for Fortune is nothing but the Will of
God. Thus the King, with the Assistance of the <i>Portuguses</i>,
<span class="marginnote"><i>He is restored.</i></span> recover&rsquo;d
his Throne, casting down his Brother, and defeating him, till he was
utterly destroy&rsquo;d. Hatred is frequently no less intense than Love
among those whom Nature has most closly link&rsquo;d. In the
<i>Molucco</i> Islands the War did not cease, nor the general Malice
against Christians.</p>
<p>The News of what had happened there was not known in <i>Europe</i>,
where, and in <i>Africk</i> greater Dangers were apprehended; of the
Event whereof <span class="marginnote"><i>A Prodigy.</i></span>
Providence thought fit to inform our free Wills, by stupendious
Prodigies. On the 15th of <i>June</i> 1580, about the declining of the
Day, there appear&rsquo;d to certain Sailers a Large Crucifix in the
Body of the Sun the Foot of the Cross standing on Mount <i>Calvary</i>,
as we see in common Pictures; on the Right Side of it a Figure clad in
White, and another on the left in a deep Red. The Crucifix ascended
upwards, and was still seen to mount till the Sun Setting, the Day shut
in. This was seen by all those who came in a Caravel, from the Island
of St. <i>Michael</i> ten Leagues before they came to that of St.
<i>George</i>, the Bishop whereof residing in that of <i>Angla</i>,
sent the Affidavit of it to King <i>Philip</i> the Second, which was
receiv&rsquo;d and much talked of by the Judge <i>Freytas</i>, a grave
Person. All the Men of the Caravel sign&rsquo;d it, as Eye-Witnesses,
who affirm, That being touch&rsquo;d with it, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span>they
confess&rsquo;d their Sins at the Sight of the Prodigy, begging Mercy
with Sighs and Tears. Our Understandings ought to stand amaz&rsquo;d,
and praise, him that produces both what is Natural, and Miraculous, and
who by so many Warnings shows us, that he has reserv&rsquo;d Times, and
Moments in his own Hand.</p>
<p>King <i>Sebastian</i>, at that Time, had other Conquests in View.
The Loss or the Recovery of <i>Ternate</i> and the neighbouring
<i>Moluccos</i> concern&rsquo;d him alone; but he referr&rsquo;d that
to the Governour of <i>India</i>; whilst he himself, solicited by the
<i>Xerif Muley Mahomet</i>, whom he design&rsquo;d to set upon the
<span class="marginnote"><i>King</i> Sebastian <i>prepares for the War
in</i> Africk.</span> Throne of <i>Morocco</i>, tho&rsquo; with a good
Design, joyn&rsquo;d the <i>African</i> Army, with another of
Catholicks, consisting of the <i>Portuguese</i> Gentry, of
<i>Spaniards</i>, <i>Italians</i>, and <i>Germans</i>. And, if we may
believe those who committed that Expedition to writing, he went over
into <i>Africk</i>, contrary to all the known Rules and Maxims of
Martial Prudence, which Proportions <span class="corr" id="xd21e8055"
title="Source: the the">the</span> Strength to the Undertaking, to
ascertain the Success and forecasts, in Case Things prosper, to secure
and preserve them. This he did upon the Assurances the <i>Xerif</i>
gave him, that as soon as ever the <i>Portuguese</i> Forces
appear&rsquo;d, the People would submit to him. But God permitted that
most Christian Prince <span class="marginnote"><i>Is Kill&rsquo;d
there.</i></span> to be kill&rsquo;d, the <i>Xerif</i> perishing with
him; and their Armies to be routed, <i>Muley Moluc</i> the third Person
remaining Victorious, tho&rsquo; he also dy&rsquo;d in the same Battel,
and was bury&rsquo;d in triumphant Manner. The Prodigies, and Fears of
the wiser sort were verify&rsquo;d in the King of <i>Portugal</i>, and
particularly that which happen&rsquo;d before his Birth. It is
certainly reported, that the Princess <i>Joanna</i> his Mother, one
Night saw a great Number of <i>Moors</i> come into her Chamber, in the
Palace at <i>Lisbon</i>, clad in several Colours; <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Prodigy.</i></span> she believ&rsquo;d or fancy&rsquo;d
they might be those they call <i>Monetros</i>, who are such as do the
Duty of Guards in the Royal Apartment. Some went out to enquire, and
found them all still, as husht as at other Times. The Princess seeing
the imaginary <i>Moors</i> come in again, swoon&rsquo;d away in her
Ladies Arms. Afterwards at the proper Time, she was deliver&rsquo;d of
King <i>Sebastian</i>, whose singular Virtues, supported by the Loyalty
of his Subjects, might have shin&rsquo;d as bright as his natural
Magnanimity, had not that hasten&rsquo;d his End. That was
mourn&rsquo;d for and lamented by all Christendom, and brought Trouble
to all its Princes, who began seriously to discourse about the
Successor to the Crown of <i>Portugal</i>. There they presently swore
<span class="marginnote">Henry <i>the Cardinal King</i>.</span>
<i>Henry</i>, the Prince Cardinal, Unkle to the late King, then Eighty
Years of Age, and the last Lawful Male of that Royal House, which began
in another of his Name. <i>Antony</i>, Prior of <i>Crato</i>, Son to
Prince <i>Lewis</i>, pretended to succeed him, and tho&rsquo;
declar&rsquo;d illegitimate, there was a Party that follow&rsquo;d him.
This Revolution, and the Hurry in such difficult Exigences, were the
Occasion, that Care was not taken to supply other Places, much nearer
than <i>Ternate</i>. Besides that dismal Accounts brought 5000 Leagues,
tho&rsquo; they were represented by <i>Demosthenes</i>, would come cold
from his Mouth and scarce move the best dispos&rsquo;d Prince, when
never so much at Leasure; and King <i>Henry</i>, had no Power, but only
his Zeal for Religion, to oppose the Tyranny practis&rsquo;d in the
<i>Archipelago</i> of the <i>Moluccos</i>. The Cardinal King thought
all his Forces little enough, and necessary considering the
extraordinary Jealousie he had conceiv&rsquo;d, upon our King
<i>Philip</i>&rsquo;s declaring himself a Pretender to those Kingdoms,
and having order&rsquo;d a considerable <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb70" href="#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span>Army to make up to the
frontiers, which he had drawn together during the said Cardinal&rsquo;s
Life. The Generals were the Duke of <i>Alva</i>, and the Marquess <i>de
Santa Cruz</i>, the first at Land, the other at Sea; and in the mean
while the ablest Divines and Civilians of <i>Europe</i>, in all the
Schools, and Parliaments writ concerning his Right.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>First</i> English <i>Voyage to the</i>
Moluccos.</span> The Year before, being 1579, about the Beginning of
it, Q. <i>Elizabeth</i> of <i>England</i>, seeing the Princes of
<i>Europe</i>, particularly those in the Western Parts, make Warlike
Preparations, as being divided in Opinions; form Leagues, and direct
all their Designs towards the Kingdom of <i>Portugal</i>, she to make
some Diversion with Security, had on a sudden fitted out four Ships, of
eighteen Brass Guns each, and in them two hundred Men, and ten young
Gentlemen, who besides employing their Valour, on such Occasions as it
should offer, were to be very intent upon the Business of Navigation
for greater Ends. She appointed <i>Francis Drake</i> of the County of
<i>Devon</i> their Commander in Chief; who at his own, or at the Charge
of <i>John Hawkins</i>, from whom he stole a great Quantity of Gold and
Silver at <i>S. John de Ulva</i>, <span class="marginnote"><i>Sir</i>
Francis Drake <i>his Voyage</i>.</span> in the Year 1566, added some
more Ships. He set sail from the Port of <i>Plymouth</i>, for the South
Sea, and to find out that Streight of <i>Magellan</i>, scarce believed
by the Vulgar, and declar&rsquo;d by several Cosmographers. He
promis&rsquo;d to sail as much as might be to the Northward, and to
take rich Prizes, infesting all those remote Seas, and to return
Victorious into <i>England</i>, through the same Streight. This
presumptuous Hope he grounded on his own Valour, on the Negligence of
the <i>Spaniards</i>, who are intrusted with the Places of Strength; on
our want of Ships; and above all on that Opportunity, or Season so full
of sundry and extraordinary Commotions. He touch&rsquo;d on the Coast
of <i>Africk</i>, and refitted all his Ships at Cape <i>Bojador</i>.
The <i>Moors</i> took two of his Men, and a <i>Portuguese</i> Ship
pay&rsquo;d for it, he robbing her at <i>Cabo Blanco</i> of an hundred
Quintals, or hundred Weight of Bisket, besides much Fish, and many
Arms. He touch&rsquo;d at the Islands of <i>Cabo Verde</i>, where he
took another small <i>Portuguese</i> Vessel, richly Laden with Wine,
Cloth, Holland, and several other Commodities, with <i>Sylva</i>, the
Pilot in it, who was well acquainted with those Seas, and better on the
Coast of <i>Brazil</i>. But six or seven Days after the Vessel sunk,
and not a Man was sav&rsquo;d except only the said Pilot. <i>Drake</i>
went on to the River of <i>Plate</i>, and Winter&rsquo;d for some
Months in <i>S. Julians</i> Bay, which is not well shelter&rsquo;d, but
expos&rsquo;d to excessive cold Winds, in 50 Degrees of South Latitude,
where he lost some Men.</p>
<p>One <i>Thomas Haughton</i> rais&rsquo;d a Mutiny there, in order to
Debauch the Squadron, <i>Drake</i> laid hold of him, and struck off his
Head. Here they <span class="marginnote"><i>Giants.</i></span> saw
eight <i>Indian</i> Giants to whom the tallest <i>Englishman</i>
look&rsquo;d like a Dwarf. They show&rsquo;d their Bows and Arrows, and
an <i>Englishman</i>, who valu&rsquo;d himself upon his Dexterity at
those Weapons, breaking the Peace establish&rsquo;d with those People,
let fly an Arrow at one of them, which pierced him through, and he
dropt; the others in Revenge discharged theirs, and kill&rsquo;d two of
the <i>English</i>. The rest then assail&rsquo;d the <i>Indians</i>,
but they fled so swiftly that they seem&rsquo;d not, to those
<i>English</i> who saw and writ this, to set their Feet on the Ground.
They departed thence, as soon as the North Winds they had expected to
blow, and holding on their Course to the Southward, in fifteen Days
came to the Mouth of the Streight. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71"
href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>From thence to the second
Narrowing they spent five Days, by reason of the Currents and Shoals;
at a small distance from them they found no Bottom. They met with some
Calms and Storms, and being come into the South-Sea had one which
lasted forty Days, and in it lost some Ships. The Vice-Admiral
return&rsquo;d through the same Streight into <i>England</i>, where the
Queen order&rsquo;d him to be Hang&rsquo;d for having forsaken his
Admiral; but he was repriev&rsquo;d till <i>Drakes</i> Return, and the
Pardon&rsquo;d, at his Request. He went on with only his own and some
other Ships, but wanted not Men, Provisions, nor Ammunition, he took
some belonging to private Persons, and the Kings, loaded with the Plate
they were bringing for <i>Spain</i>, a Robbery of <span class=
"marginnote">Drake <i>takes the Kings Plate</i>.</span> great
Consequence, not so much for the Quantity of the Treasure, as for the
Use it is apply&rsquo;d to in our Monarchy, which is the Advancement of
the Catholick Church, and which thereby ceas&rsquo;d, and deplorable
for the unjust Abuses it was to be apply&rsquo;d to in Scismatical
Kingdoms. Having wander&rsquo;d, Steering various Courses, in which his
Pilots made their Observations by Sounding and their Charts, he
touch&rsquo;d at six Islands, to some whereof he gave Names, in
Imitation of the fabulous Heroes, and even of true Catholicks, who
assign such Names according to their particular Devotion. One he
call&rsquo;d <i>S. Bartholomew</i>, another <i>S. James</i>, and a
third, which <span class="marginnote"><i>He gives Names to
Islands.</i></span> he thought larger and more fruitful, <i>New
Albion</i>, from the Ancient Name of <i>England</i>, <i>this is
California</i>. There he stay&rsquo;d a Month and a half, refitting his
Ships, and sailing thence to those call&rsquo;d <i>de los Ladrones</i>,
or of Thieves, in nine Degrees of North Latitude, kill&rsquo;d 20
<i>Indians</i>, because they attack&rsquo;d him with 100 <i>Canoas</i>.
Twenty Days after, he came to an Anchor at the <i>Molucco</i> Islands,
having before touch&rsquo;d at others, without any Action <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Arrives at the</i> Moluccos.</span> worth remembering.
His Cruelties, and Robberies might well gain him the Title of the
greatest of Pyrates, in those remotest Parts, as he had it in
<i>Europe</i>. He came to <i>Ternate</i>, but succeeded not at first,
that People being War-like, and at that time Arm&rsquo;d by their own
Malice, and an implacable King. He attempted to barter for Clove,
without his Leave, was inform&rsquo;d how severely he handled such as
Transgress&rsquo;d, and slighting the Advice, the King came to hear of
it, and order&rsquo;d him to be Kill&rsquo;d. It came very near the
Execution; but <i>Drake</i>, whose Genious well experienced in Frauds
was no Stranger to Dissimulation, retir&rsquo;d to his Ships, to make
his Escape by Flight. Thence he contriv&rsquo;d to appease the King,
which was no difficult Matter, by means of some Presents he sent him.
With them he purchas&rsquo;d the good Will, and an Audience of that
cunning Tyrant, and going ashore several Times to visit him, agreed he
should enter into Amity with the Queen, and Nation of <i>England</i>,
and that Factories should be settled out of Hand. The King consented,
and <i>Drake</i> promis&rsquo;d him the Protection and Arms of
<i>England</i>; and taking with him, among other Gifts, a rich Ring the
King gave him for the Queen, he sail&rsquo;d homewards, with a great
quantity of Clove. He met a <i>Portuguese</i> Ship crossing the small
Channel of <i>Tydore</i>, but either durst not, or thought not fit to
attack her, whether it was for being Inferior in Strength, or out of a
Desire of securing the new acquir&rsquo;d Wealth. Scarce was he got
clear of <i>Ternate</i>, before the Winds began to toss him, in that
Sea full of Flats, whence they forc&rsquo;d him, in order <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Is in a Storm.</i></span> to deliver him quite up to
Tempests. He was oblig&rsquo;d to lighten his Ships, and among other
Things of Value, threw over-Board a Cannon, of an extraordinary
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name=
"pb72">72</a>]</span>Bigness, which the King of <i>Ternate</i>, hearing
afterwards of the Storm, caused to be taken out of the deep Sea. Then
he built a House before his Palace, on the Roof whereof he planted it
openly, and pointing over, either on Account of its Magnitude, or by
way of Ostentation, and in Memory of the first <i>Englishman</i>, that
came into his Kingdoms, from whom and the Sea he had taken that new
offensive Booty. <i>Drake</i> went on to the greater <i>Java</i>, where
he laid in Provisions of <i>Cazabi</i>, <i>Plantans</i>, and
<i>Floul</i>, in exchange for Cloth. Next he put into another Island,
in four Degrees of North Latitude, where he stay&rsquo;d six Weeks.
There he left a Woman, and two Men, all Blacks, that belong&rsquo;d to
him, giving them Fire, Rice, and some Grain, that they might People the
Place. An Heroick Foundation of a Colony. Then he continu&rsquo;d his
Voyage, turning in and out to several Places, with unexpected Dammage
to all those he touch&rsquo;d at.</p>
<p>It is to be observ&rsquo;d, that it being possitively believed in
<i>Spain</i> and the <i>Indies</i>, <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Reflection of the</i> Spanish <i>Author</i>.</span>
that none had ever pass&rsquo;d the Streights of <i>Magellan</i>, since
the first Discoverer, except <i>F. Garcia de Loaysa</i>, and one of the
Ships sent by <i>Don Gutierre de Vargas</i>, Bishop of <i>Palencia</i>,
to the Spice-Islands, it was look&rsquo;d upon as incredible, that any
Pyrates were come into the South-Sea, especially through the Streight,
and to the Islands of <i>Ternate</i>, and that <i>Archipelago</i>. This
Man was the first that open&rsquo;d the Passage to the Sectaries
<i>Hugonots</i>, <i>Lutherans</i>, and <i>Calvinists</i>, who
afterwards pierc&rsquo;d into those Seas, with Ship Loads of perverted
Texts, Heretical Bibles, and other Books of unsound Doctrine; but the
Divine Providence has given Proofs, that it is so much Offended at this
Hellish Innovation, tho&rsquo; it permits Idolatry, and
<i>Mahometanism</i>, that it has not suffer&rsquo;d those Souls which
through its profound Judgments, lie involv&rsquo;d in the Shades and
Darkness of Ignorance, to imbibe that Poyson, till it sent them the
Gospel in its Purity. It has Oppos&rsquo;d those new Apostacies making
use of, as Instruments of <i>Spanish</i> Religious Men, giving Strength
to our King, who protects them, his main Design being the Support of
Religion. This Truth plainly appears in the many Victories the Church
has obtain&rsquo;d through his Officers, and the Armies
maintain&rsquo;d in the remotest Parts of the Monarchy, for the
Propagation of the Faith preach&rsquo;d to the most distant
<i>Indians</i>.</p>
<p>But the better to demonstrate this true Forecast and Care, I think
it a <span class="marginnote"><i>Reason for this Digression.</i></span>
necessary Digression, so far from being superfluous, to relate the
<span class="corr" id="xd21e8452" title=
"Source: Preparati-tions">Preparations</span> made by the Viceroy
<i>Don Francisco de Toledo</i>, directing his Actions to this End, as
became a Minister who follow&rsquo;d his Princes Designs, in Order to
secure himself against <i>Drake</i>&rsquo;s surprizing Celerity and
Boldness; for as much of this as concerns the <i>Molucco</i> Islands,
obliges us to write it, and we will slightly run over all the
particular Passages.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Preparations of the Viceroy.</i></span>
The Viceroy of <i>Peru</i> was of Opinion, That in Order to secure the
<i>Indies</i>, their Peace and Religion, and for the removing, at
first, of all Obstacles to its Exaltation, and making Examples for a
Warning, it was of the greatest Consequence to erect Forts, as divine
and humane politick Precautions, and to Arm against that Pyrate, so to
give a Check to the Northern Parts by his Punishment. To this Purpose,
and in Order to his Destruction, a more exact Observation was to be
taken of the Passes into the South-Sea, and more particularly of the
Way he was to take, to return into his own Country. He was egg&rsquo;d
on by Fear, or the Loss of Reputation, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb73" href="#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span>because some English
Ships, Part of <i>Drake</i>&rsquo;s Squadron, ran along the Coasts of
<i>Chile</i> and <i>Arica</i>, obliging the People to Arm; it being
apprehended that <i>Drake</i> had erected Forts to secure the Passage,
for carrying on the Trade of Spice and Jewels, and the bringing in of
perverting Ministers with their poisonous Doctrines. For this Effect,
he pitch&rsquo;d upon <i>Peter Sarmiento de Gamboa</i>, a Gentleman of
<i>Galicia</i>, who had twice already engag&rsquo;d with that Pyrate.
The first in the Port of <i>Callao</i> near <i>Lima</i>, where he took
from him a <i>Spanish</i> Ship, laden with Commodities of <i>Spain</i>;
the second a few Days after, pursuing him as far as <i>Panama</i>. The
Viceroy resolv&rsquo;d he should go to discover the Streights of
<i>Magellan</i>, an Enterprize look&rsquo;d upon as impractable by the
South Sea, by Reason of the many Mouths and Channels which obstruct the
Access to it, where many <span class="marginnote"><i>Difficultie of the
Streight of</i> Magellan.</span> Discoverers sent by the Governours of
<i>Peru</i> and <i>Chile</i> have been lost. Others have attempted it,
entering from the North Sea, and miss&rsquo;d of the Streight; some
were cast away, or beaten back by Storm, and all generally
despair&rsquo;d of finding it. But now that Terror being remov&rsquo;d,
they can take a fix&rsquo;d Latitude, settle a Rumb, and steer a safe
Course to the Streight, so to secure the Passage before an Enemy
possesses himself of it. The Viceroy made Choice of two Ships, which he
took Care to see well rigg&rsquo;d, arm&rsquo;d and provided.
<i>Sarmiento</i> call&rsquo;d the Bigger, <i>Our Lady of Hope</i>,
which was Commodore; the other being subordinate, had the Name of <i>S.
Francis</i>. Two Hundred Seamen and Soldiers were put into them, with
virtuous and learned Religious Men, fit for that Employ. <span class=
"marginnote">Sarmiento <i>sent after</i> Drake <i>with two
Ships.</i></span> Captain <i>John de Villalobos</i> was appointed
Vice-Admiral. <i>Ferdinand Lamero</i> Head Pilot, and under him
<i>Ferdinand Alonso</i> and <i>Antony Pablo</i>, all of them very able
Pilots in both Seas. These took an Oath of Fidelity, and the Viceroy
gave the Admiral particular Instructions, the Purport whereof was, That
they should pursue the Pyrate, fight him till taken or kill&rsquo;d,
and recover the great Booty he had taken upon the King&rsquo;s Lands
<span class="marginnote"><i>His Instructions.</i></span> and Ships,
whatsoever the Hazard might be, since they had sufficient Men, Arms and
Ammunition to overcome the Enemy. That they should sail into 50 or 54
Degrees of South Latitude, as might be most Advantageous, about the
Mouth of the Streights of <i>Magellan</i>. That both Ships should have
Lights out at Night, that so they might not lose Sight of one another
in the Dark, but always keep together. He charg&rsquo;d them to be
unanimous in their Consultations, particularly the two Commanders;
which Direction was not so well observ&rsquo;d, as it ought to have
been, thro&rsquo; the Vice-Admiral&rsquo;s Fault. They were commanded
to lay down the Ports, and Seas in exact Draughts. To take Possession
of any Country they landed on for his Majesty. When they met with any
Towns of <i>Indians</i>, to mollify and endear them by discreet
Courtesy, and gain their Affections with such Gifts, as should for that
Purpose be deliver&rsquo;d to the Commodore, being Sissars, Combs,
Knives, Fishing-Hooks, Buttons of several Colours, Looking-Glasses,
Hawks-Bells, Glass-Beads, <i>&amp;c.</i> To carry with them some
<i>Indians</i> to serve for Interpreters; and so provided discreetly
for all other material Points. Then to encourage them he made a Speech,
intermixing it with Hopes and Exhortations. The Commodore having
conferr&rsquo;d with his Vice-Admiral and Pilots, concerning the Design
of their Voyage; they agreed, That if any Stress of Weather should
happen to part the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74"
name="pb74">74</a>]</span>one Ship from the other, they should
carefully seek one another out, or make the Mouth of the Streight in
the South-Sea to the Westward, there to wait for one another. The next
Day being <i>Sunday</i>, the 11th of <i>October</i>, 1579<span class=
"corr" id="xd21e8582" title="Source: .">,</span> when they had all
confess&rsquo;d and receiv&rsquo;d the Holy Eucharist, they
embark&rsquo;d in order to introduce the Faith into those Nations void

General, or Commodore <i>Sarmiento</i>, <i>F. Antony de Guadramiro</i>,
of the Order of <i>S. Francis</i>, and Vicar-General of this
Expedition; the Ensign <i>John Gutierrez de Guevara</i>, <i>Antony

Latitude. On the first of <i>November</i> they pass&rsquo;d in Sight of
those they call Unfortunate, in 25 Degrees, 20 Minutes, which were
accidentally discover&rsquo;d by the Pilot <i>John Fernandez</i>, being
bound for <i>Chile</i> the second Time, immediately after
<i>Magellan</i>&rsquo;s Discovery, since the Year 1520. They are now
call&rsquo;d, the Islands of <i>S. Felix</i>, and <i>S. Ambor</i>. Here
<i>Sarmiento</i> observ&rsquo;d the Difference, betwixt this Course,
which he calls the True one, and the Imaginary. This he noted down
<span class="marginnote"><i>His Care and Capacity.</i></span> with
extraordinary Curiosity, employing all the Care and Art of his Pilots,
and his own, which was not inferior to theirs, nor to others in any
Martial Knowledge, as will appear by his Treatises, if publish&rsquo;d,
of Navigation, casting great Guns and Bullets, Fortification, and
Knowledge in Astronomy, for failing in all Seas. They never quitted the
Lead, the Astrolabe, and the Charts, either in the Deep, in Ports,
Bays, or among Mountains, and Currents, which produc&rsquo;d a very
ample Relation he sent to King <i>Philip</i>, whence we took this
Abridgement. There he sets down the Points in the Heaven answering to
the Earth, the Dangers, Islands, Promontories and Gulphs,
Geographically and Corographically. He lays down the Rumbs that are to
be follow&rsquo;d, and those to be avoided; and thus distinctly leads
us into and thro&rsquo; the Streight, giving visible Signs, and also
invisible of the Winds for all Ports. At the first unknown Land, where
he anchor&rsquo;d, they found the Latitude to be 49 Degrees and a half
<span class="marginnote"><i>Land at the Mouth of the
Streights.</i></span> South. They saw no People, but Tokens of them, as
the Prints of Mens Feet, Darts, Oars, and little Nets. They
climb&rsquo;d up vast high Mountains, above two Leagues in the Ascent,
over Stones, some of them so sharp, that they cut their Shoes. Others,
to avoid them, made their way on the Boughs of Trees. From the Top they
discover&rsquo;d great Channels, Inlets, Rivers, and Harbours, and all
the Land as far as their Sight could reach, seem&rsquo;d to them cut
and rent asunder. They judg&rsquo;d it to be an <i>Archipelago</i>. It
is to be observ&rsquo;d, that our Discoverers give the Name of
<i>Archipelagos</i>, to Seas in the New <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e8684" title="Source: Word">World</span>, which are strew&rsquo;d
thick with Islands, as it were great Stones, like the
<i>Archipelago</i> of <i>Greece</i>, so well known to all Nations in
the <i>Egean</i> Sea, which contains the <i>Cyclades</i>, tho&rsquo;
the Name is not ancient. They perceiv&rsquo;d the Channel to run on,
Wide, Spacious, Open and Clean; and were satisfi&rsquo;d that
<i>Drake</i> came out that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href=
"#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>Way into the South Sea. They found
the Latitude by three <i>Astrolabes</i> to be 50 Degrees. The Harbour
they call&rsquo;d of, <i>Our Lady of the Rosary</i>, and the Island of
the most Holy Trinity.</p>
<p>The next <i>Sunday</i>, <i>Sarmiento</i> order&rsquo;d all the Men
to land, in order to take Possession, and perform&rsquo;d all that is
contain&rsquo;d in the Authentick Instrument <span class=

Glory, and in his most Holy Name, Be it known to all those who shall
see this Instrument, that this Day, being <i>Sunday</i> the 22d of
<i>November</i>, 1579<span class="corr" id="xd21e8738" title=
"Source: .">,</span> this Royal Navy of the Mighty Renowned Lord, King
<i>Philip</i> of <i>Spain</i>, and its other Dominions, my Sovereign,
being arriv&rsquo;d in this Country by Order of the most Excellent
Lord, <i>Don Francisco de Toledo</i>, Viceroy, Governour, and Captain
General of <i>Peru</i>, to discover the Streight of <i>Magellan</i>,
under the Command of the General <i>Peter Sarmiento</i>, the Land by
him nam&rsquo;d, <i>Our Lady of the Rosary</i>, and the Bay of, <i>The
most Holy Trinity</i>. The said Lord General having landed with most of
the Sea and Landmen belonging to his Navy, and the Religious Men, he
brought ashore a Cross, which he devoutly worshipp&rsquo;d, with all
his Men. The Religious Men sang the Hymn <i>Te Deum laudamus</i>, and
he with a loud Voice, said, That in the Name of his Majesty
<i>Philip</i> the Second, our Lord, King of <i>Castile</i> and
<i>Aragon</i>, and their Dependencies, whom our Lord God long preserve,
with the Addition of greater Kingdoms and Dominions, for the Glory of
God, and Good and Prosperity of his Subjects; and in the Name of the
most Potent Kings his Heirs and Successors for the Time being; he, as
his Commander in chief, and Admiral of this same Navy, and by Virtue of
the Order and Instructions given him in his Majesty&rsquo;s Royal Name,
by the said Lord Viceroy of <i>Peru</i>, took, did take, seiz&rsquo;d,
and did seize the Possession of this Land on which he is now ashore,
and which he has discover&rsquo;d for evermore, in the said Royal Name,
and of the said Crown of <i>Castile</i> and <i>Leon</i>, as has been
said, as being his own, and really belonging to him, by Virtue of the
Donation and Gift the Holy Father <i>Alexander</i> the Sixth, Pope of
<i>Rome</i>, pass&rsquo;d <i>Motu proprio</i>, in Favour of their
Catholick Majesties <i>Ferdinand</i> the Fifth and <i>Isabel</i> his
Wife, King and Queen of <i>Castile</i> and <i>Leon</i> of glorious
Memory, and to their Heirs and Successors, of the one half of the
World, being 180 Degrees of Longitude, as is more fully contain&rsquo;d
in the said Bull, dated at <i>Rome</i>, on the 4th of <i>May</i>, 1493.
By Virtue whereof, these said Lands fall, lye, and are included within
the Limits and Meridian of the said Partition of 180 Degrees of
Longitude, belonging to the said Royal Crown of <i>Castile</i> and
<i>Leon</i>. And as such he takes, and did take Possession of these
said Lands, and their Territories, Seas, Rivers, Creeks, Ports, Bays,
Gulphs, <i>Archipelagos</i>, and of this said Harbour of the
<i>Rosary</i>, where at present this Navy is at Anchor. And he
subjects, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=
"pb76">76</a>]</span>and did subject them to the Power, Possession and
Dominion of the said Royal Crown, as has been said, as being their own
Property. And in Token of Possession, or as it were, drawing the Sword
he had by his Side, with it he cut Trees, Branches, and Grass, and
remov&rsquo;d Stones, and walk&rsquo;d over the Fields and Shores,
without any Opposition; requiring such as were present to be Witnesses
thereof, and me the underwritten Notary, to give him a Testimonial
thereof in publick Form. And immediately, taking up a great Cross, and
the Men belonging to the Navy being drawn up in a martial Manner, with
Muskets and other Arms, they carry&rsquo;d the Cross in Procession, the
Religious Men, <i>F. Antony de Guadramiro</i>, the Vicar and his
Companion, singing the Litany, and all the others answering. And the
said Procession being ended, the said Lord General planted the Cross on
a hard Rock, and rais&rsquo;d a heap of Stones at the Foot of the
Cross, in Token, and as a Memorial of Possession of all the Lands and
Seas, discover&rsquo;d, adjacent, and contiguous. And he gave the Name
of <i>Our Lady of the Rosary</i> to this Port, as has been said. And as
soon as the Cross was set up, they worshipp&rsquo;d it a second Time;
and they all pray&rsquo;d, beseeching and intreating our Lord
<span class="ex"><i>JESUS CHRIST</i></span>, would be pleas&rsquo;d
that what they did might be for his Glory, and to the End that our Holy
Catholick Faith might be exalted and dilated, and the Holy Gospel
preach&rsquo;d and spread abroad among these barbarous Nations, which
have hitherto been remote from the true Knowledge and Doctrine; that it
may defend and deliver them from the Frauds and Dangers of the Devil,
and from the Blindness they are in, that their Souls may be
sav&rsquo;d. And then the Religious Men sung in Honour of the Cross,
the Hymn <i>Vexilla Regis</i>. Next the Father Vicar said Mass on an
Altar there erected, being the first that was ever said in that
Country, to the Honour and Glory of our Almighty Lord God, and for the
Extirpation of the Devil and all Idolatry. And he preach&rsquo;d to
that Purpose, and some confess&rsquo;d and communicated. And as soon as
the Mass was said, the General, for a more absolute Token and Memorial
of Possession, caus&rsquo;d a large Tree to be trimm&rsquo;d, and on it
caus&rsquo;d a very high Cross to be made, and on it plac&rsquo;d the
most Holy Name of our Lord <span class="ex"><i>JESUS CHRIST</i></span>.
<span class="ex"><i>J. N. R. I.</i></span> And under it, <i>Philippus
Secundus Rex Hispaniarum</i>. Of all which, I <i>John de Esquivel</i>,
Royal Secretary to this Navy and Admiral Ship, do give Affidavit and
true Testimony, that it was so done as is said. Then follows
<i>Esquivel</i>&rsquo;s Subscription.<span class="corr" id="xd21e8864"
title="Not in source">&rsquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Sarmiento <i>gives Names to
Places</i>.</span> Four Days after, <i>Sarmiento</i>, in the
Vice-Admiral&rsquo;s Boat, with the Pilots, <i>Pablos</i> and
<i>Lamero</i>, and ten Sailors and Soldiers, with Muskets, Bucklers and
Swords, and four Days Provision, set out of this Port to discover the
Channels they saw, that they might not endanger the Ships. Going out by
the Ridges of Rocks, he run along the Gulph, close to the Shore, all
which he observ&rsquo;d, and sounded the Harbours, giving Names to them
and the Mountains, according to their Shapes, such as
<i>Sugar-Loaves</i>, <i>Pitchers</i>, <i>Guinea Peppers</i>, and the
like. He observ&rsquo;d the Trees, the Plants and the Birds. At one
Place on the Shore he found several Tracts of People, and two Poniards
or such Weapons made of Bone, with a Cross on the Handles, near a small
Stream of fresh Water, whose <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href=
"#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>Sands are Red, and therefore he
call&rsquo;d it the <i>Red-River</i>, which falls into a Harbour, and
that also took the same Name. They saw abundance of Fish, and among the
Shells thrown up by the Sea, vast Quantities of Oysters and Mussels,
and in those that were left upon the Rocks above the Water, great and
small Pearls, some Grey, others White. This Sort of <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Pearls despis&rsquo;d for Hunger.</i></span> Fish, at
certain Times, the Shells being first open, gape with their Mouths, and
receive the pure and substantial Dew, which, as it were, impregnates
them with Pearls, which are in Colour answerable to the Nature of the
Dew. If they receive it pure, they produce them white; if
disturb&rsquo;d, they are of a Dark, or other Muddy Colours.
<i>Sarmiento</i> describes the Vexation that tormented him and his Men;
for being eager to satisfy their Hunger with Oysters and Mussels, and
they being unfit to Eat, because of the Hardness of those Pearls they
found in them, they threw them away, cursing the Inventors of putting a
Value on those Productions, or Hornynesses of Fishes, which Nature had
trebly hid in the Waters of the Sea, in Shells, and in the Fish it
self. They said, that true Wealth consisted in tame Cattle, Fruit, and
Corn brought up by Tillage, as they had in <i>Spain</i>; for that
precious Obstacle to feeding, then not valu&rsquo;d, depriving them of
the Sustenance of the Shell-Fish, and being forc&rsquo;d to live ten
Days on the Provision they brought for four, the Fast made them all
Philosophers. From this Red Harbour, he was obliged to return to the
Ships left in that of the <i>Rosary</i>, no Day passing without violent
Storms; when they had run backward, and forward, above 70 Leagues,
landing on Islands, and taking Possession of them. They were Fruitful
and Habitable, but till then Untill&rsquo;d and Desart. From a very
high Hill, he discover&rsquo;d the main Chanel, which runs out into the
great Ocean, and so many other Channels and small Islands, that they
could not be reckon&rsquo;d up in a long Time. Whilst he staid, he
sounded Harbours, Deeps, Channels, Creeks, Inlets, Flats, Roads and
Bays, making Draughts of, and giving them Names. He settled the
Latitude, and certain Course to be steer&rsquo;d, in the Presence, and
with the Opinion of the Pilots, Seamen, and Soldiers, in order to
reconcile those disagreeing Persons by examining all that were
present.</p>
<p>Here the Vice-Admiral began to <span class="corr" id="xd21e8915"
title="Source: caivl">cavil</span>, saying, They were imbay&rsquo;d,
and <span class="marginnote"><i>Vice-Admiral disagrees with</i>
Sarmiento.</span> that it was impossible to hold on their Voyage that
Way; and would have quitted his Admiral, as he did afterwards. From
<i>Red-Port</i> they held on their Course, trying those in other
Islands. <i>Sarmiento</i> came to a Bay, which he call&rsquo;d <i>S.
Francis</i>&rsquo;s, where, as they were taking their Station, a
Soldier fired a Piece at some Birds, and in Answer to the Gun, certain
<i>Indians</i>, near a Mountain, on the other Side of the Bay, gave
horrid Shouts. By the first Noise, the <i>Spaniards</i> thought it had
been made by Sea-Wolves, till they discover&rsquo;d the naked Red
Bodies. They afterwards <span class="marginnote"><i>Painted</i>
Indians.</span> found the Reason of that Colour, for they daub&rsquo;d
themselves from the Head to the Feet with a glutinous Red-Earth.
<i>Sarmiento</i> took some of his Company into a Boat, and coming to a
Thicket, found them in the closest of the Trees, without any other
Cloathing but that Clay as Red as Blood. Only one old Man, who
talk&rsquo;d to, and commanded, and was obey&rsquo;d by them,
appear&rsquo;d cover&rsquo;d with a Cloak of the Skins of <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e8947" title="Source: Sea Wolves">Sea-Wolves</span>.
Fifteen Youths came out upon the open Shore, near the <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e8950" title="Source: Sea-and">Sea and</span> drawing
near, with peaceable Demonstrations, very earnestly pointed,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name=
"pb78">78</a>]</span>lifting up their Hands towards the Place where the
Ships remain&rsquo;d. The <i>Spaniards</i> did the same. The
<i>Indians</i> came close, and <i>Sarmiento</i> giving them two Towels
and a Night-cap, for he had nothing else then, and the Pilots some
other Trifles, they were well pleas&rsquo;d. They gave them Wine, which
they tasted and then threw away. They eat of the Bisket, but all this
did not satisfy them; for which Reason, and because they were on an
open Shore, in Danger of losing the Boat, they return&rsquo;d to their
Station, making Signs to the <i>Indians</i> to go to the Boat. They did
so, and <i>Sarmiento</i> posted two Sentinels for the more Security,
then forcibly seiz&rsquo;d one of the <i>Indians</i> for an
Interpreter, put him into his Boat, embrac&rsquo;d him lovingly,
cloath&rsquo;d and fed him. This Place he call&rsquo;d, <i>The Point of
People</i>, as being the first where he found any. Thence he proceeded
to Three small Islands, lying in a Triangle, and lay there. They went
on, taking Draughts of the Lands, and being before a very craggy
Country, the <i>Indian</i> who had never ceas&rsquo;d shedding Tears,
throwing off a Shirt they had put him on, leap&rsquo;d over-board, and
swam away. They held on their Way, quite weary of seeing so many
Islands, containing strange Productions of Nature, but without any
Inhabitants. Only in one of them, which they call&rsquo;d, <i>The Cleft
Rock</i>, near a deep Cave, they found much Tract of Men&rsquo;s Feet,
and the whole Skeleton of a Man or Woman. They went on thence with
Storms through incredible Solitudes, which it would be too much to
describe, tho&rsquo; our Design were to treat only of this Voyage. At
another Land, where they arriv&rsquo;d full of Uncertainty, as it were
by Accident, in the Bay they call&rsquo;d, <i>Our Lady of
Guadalupe</i>, thinking to discover whether one Channel ran to the
East, and another to the North; they saw a <span class=
"marginnote"><i>A</i> Piragua.</span> <i>Piragua</i>, being a Vessel
made of Planks put together, without any Sides, and sometimes of
Rushes, and of <i>Calabashes</i>, and properly a Float, coming along on
the Water, and in it five <i>Indians</i>, who getting to the Shore,
left the <i>Piragua</i>, and ran up a Mountain in a Consternation. The
Pilot went into the <i>Piragua</i>, with four Soldiers, and the Boat
proceeded further.</p>
<p>Coming to another Point, where they thought there were more People,
<span class="marginnote"><i>A Cottage and what in it.</i></span> they
only found a low round Cottage, made of Poles, and cover&rsquo;d with
broad Barks of Trees, and the Skins of Sea-Wolves. In it were little
Baskets, Shell-Fish, small Nets, and Bones for Sticking of Fish, like
Harping Irons and Scrips full of that Red Earth wherewith they dye
their Bodies, instead of Cloaths. This is all the Gayity and Habit they
use, instead of the Gold and Silks worn in the Courts of Princes.
<i>Sarmiento</i> left the <i>Piragua</i>, and return&rsquo;d to the
Ships with only the Boat, because his Provisions were spent. In this
small Vessel, and a Brigantine, he found newly built by his Company,
whilst they were viewing those most desart Islands, with the Advice of
the Vice-Admiral, he went from the <i>Red Harbour</i>, and finding no
other safe for the Ships, return&rsquo;d to the same. Then in the Boat
call&rsquo;d <i>Nuestra Senora de Guia</i>, or <i>Our Lady of the
Guide</i>, he went away to make Tryal of the Mouth which appear&rsquo;d
to the Eastward under a mighty long Ridge of Snowy Mountains, so
various, that they saw some Tops cover&rsquo;d with white, others with
blew, and others <span class="marginnote"><i>Snow of several
Colours.</i></span> with black Snow. <i>Sarmiento</i> calls that the
Continent. There is no Number of the Islands he took Possession of, and
those he discover&rsquo;d, being inaccessible in other
<i>Archipelagos</i>, from the Top of a Mountain rising above
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name=
"pb79">79</a>]</span>those about it, and cover&rsquo;d with blew Snow,
which he compares to the Colour of the <i>Turky</i> Stones. This Height
he call&rsquo;d <i>Anno Nuevo</i>, that is, <i>New Year</i>, because he
found it on the first Day of the Year, 1580. He left no Saints Name, or
the Resemblance of any natural Thing, but what he apply&rsquo;d to
distinguish those Islands he touch&rsquo;d at, erecting Crosses on them
all, and writing as he did in the first. He saw Men, only in these here
mention&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>He ran again in his Boat through those Seas, where Nature
seem&rsquo;d to set up new Islands every Day; and Anchor&rsquo;d in a
Harbour, where, among <span class="marginnote">Sarmiento&rsquo;s
<i>Industry</i>.</span> other Precautions for Navigation, he drew a
Meridian Line on the Earth, and mark&rsquo;d the Magnetick Needles,
refreshing them by touching again, because they had receiv&rsquo;d some
Damage by the Storms and Damps. How weak a Guide have Men for mighty
Enterprizes! He prosecuted his Discovery of little Islands, and taking
Possession; and observ&rsquo;d an Eclipse for the Benefit of
Navigation, in the Port of <i>Misericordia</i>, or <i>Mercy</i>, as he
nam&rsquo;d it. The Vice-Admiral not coming to him, he suppos&rsquo;d
he was return&rsquo;d to <i>Lima</i>, however he waited for him ten
Days, and five more in another newly discover&rsquo;d, and
call&rsquo;d, <i>Nuestra Senora de la Candelaria</i>, or <i>Our Lady of
Candlemas</i>, three Leagues from the other. This Time having been
agreed upon between them to expect one another, which when
expir&rsquo;d, each was to make the best of his Way into <i>Spain</i>;
<i>Sarmiento</i> being positive, contrary to the Opinion of the Pilots,
that there was the Streight of <i>Magellan</i>.</p>
<p>On St. <i>Agnes</i>&rsquo;s Day he Anchor&rsquo;d at the Island
which forms that Harbour, for which Reason he gave it that
Saint&rsquo;s Name. From the Ridge of a Hill, which hangs bending like
a Bow over a River, he perceiv&rsquo;d five Native <i>Indians</i>, who
with Cries and Signs desired him to come to them; the <i>Spaniards</i>
answering them in the same Manner, the <i>Indians</i> held up a
<span class="marginnote">Indians <i>by Signs show that</i> Drake
<i>pass&rsquo;d that Way</i>.</span> white Scarf, and our Men another.
When they were come down to the Shore, they seem&rsquo;d to request
they would draw near. <i>Sarmiento</i> sent them his Ensign, and the
Pilot <i>Ferdinand Alonso</i>, with only four Men, that they might not
fear; however they durst not come near the Boat. One of our Men went
ashore, and yet they would not trust him, yet drawing nearer because he
was alone, he gave them <i>Chaquiras</i>, that is, Glass-Beads,
Hawks-Bells, Combs, Ear-Rings, and Hempen-Cloth. Observe what mighty
Designs were couch&rsquo;d under those Childish Gifts. Then the Ensign
and Pilot came ashore, cherishing and giving them other Toys, and
show&rsquo;d them what every Thing was for, by applying it to the Use
before them. This pleas&rsquo;d them extreamly, as did some little
Linnen Flags, or Bannors, our Men carry&rsquo;d, made of narrow Slips
of <i>French</i> Linnen, Canvas, and <i>Silesia</i> Cloth. This made
<i>Sarmiento</i> judge that they had before seen <i>Europeans</i>, and
they, without being ask&rsquo;d, signify&rsquo;d by intelligible
Tokens, that two Ships like ours had pass&rsquo;d that Way, or were
still thereabouts, pointing to the South East, and in them bearded Men,
clad and arm&rsquo;d after the same Manner. This was the first
Intelligence they found of the <i>English</i> Ships under <i>Drake</i>.
The <i>Indians</i> with smiling Countenances promis&rsquo;d to come
again. They went up the Land, and our Men aboard the Ship, which not
being far off, <i>Sarmiento</i> came ashore to take Possession, with
the usual Religious and Civil Ceremony.</p>
<p>The next Day the Ensign and <i>Ferdinand Alonso</i> were with six
Soldiers by break of Day in the Harbour, carrying a considerable
Quantity of Toys, to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80"
name="pb80">80</a>]</span>gain the Affections of the Natives, who came
also; but would not draw <span class="marginnote">Spaniards <i>catch
three</i> Indians.</span> near our Men. They made the same Signs they
had the Day before. The <i>Spaniards</i> to be better informed of what
Course the <i>English</i> Steer&rsquo;d, ran at the <i>Indians</i>, and
took three of them, every two Soldiers holding one of them, and
tho&rsquo; they gave our Men many Blows and Bangs, struggling to get
loose, they could not prevail, and yet were very strong. The
<i>Spaniards</i> put up all that they might get them to the Ship, where
<i>Sarmiento</i> receiv&rsquo;d, and treated them Courteously. They Eat
and Drank, and Kindness so far prevail&rsquo;d, that they laid aside
all Fear, and Laugh&rsquo;d. Being show&rsquo;d the narrow Slips of
Linnen, they pointed with their Hands to a Bay, where the Ships had
Anchor&rsquo;d, with the bearded People, who had Arrows, and Partesans.
One of them show&rsquo;d two, and another one Wound they had
receiv&rsquo;d fighting against the Men of that Fleet.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Vice-Admiral returns to</i>
Chile.</span> The Vice-Admiral was now gone back to <i>Chile</i>, and
among other Accidents which happen&rsquo;d in his Return, he was wont
to tell, that being come to Island <i>Mocha</i>, he sent his Boat
thither to ask some supply of Provisions, and understanding how
Friendly they behav&rsquo;d themselves towards <i>Drake</i>, and that
the Hatred those People bear the <i>Spaniards</i> might be an Obstacle
to him, his Messengers, by Order, conceal&rsquo;d their being such,
pretending they were <i>Lutherans</i>. The Islanders gave Credit to the
Fiction, being desirous <span class="marginnote"><i>He deceives the</i>
Indians.</span> to gain Friends, for preserving of their Liberty.
Accordingly they sent them Flesh, Bread, and Fruit, with a Letter, in
answer to theirs, the Superscription thereof in <i>English</i> run
thus, <i>To the very Magnificent Lords</i>, <i>the</i> Lutherans, <i>in
the South Sea</i>. Our Men answer&rsquo;d, That since they had supplied
them with such plenty of Provisions, they desir&rsquo;d they would come
and partake. About 30 of the Prime <i>Caciques</i> accepted of the
Invitation, and came very Joyfully, in a <i>Canoe</i>, to our Ship. No
sooner were they Aboard, than the Vice-Admiral, not regarding their
Complaints, gave order to loose the Sails, which were ready, and
carry&rsquo;d them away Prisoners to <i>Chile</i>. Some things that
befell him, might justify his deserting his Superior, but they must be
left to those who write a particular History of those Actions.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><span class="corr" id="xd21e9223" title=
"Source: Sormiento">Sarmiento</span> <i>press&rsquo;d to go
back</i>.</span> To return to <i>Sarmiento</i>. In the aforesaid Port
of <i>Candelaria</i>, or <i>Candlemass</i>, the Pilots press&rsquo;d
him hard, with Intreaties and Protestations, to do as his Vice-Admiral
had done, representing how much his Men were harrass&rsquo;d and his
Ship disabled, and that he had done more than all the Discoverers
before him. That they wanted Anchors, Cables, and Rigging; that the
Winds oppos&rsquo;d him, without which it was impossible to proceed.
This was a Dangerous Tryal, because amidst the Complaints, and almost
Threats of the Pilots, there was a mixture of Flattery, commending him,
for that no other Discoverer had ventur&rsquo;d so far; so that
<i>Sarmiento</i> was no <span class="marginnote"><i>He is resolute, and
goes on.</i></span> less mov&rsquo;d by their Praises than by their
Anger. However he bore up against both, and severely check&rsquo;d the
Pilots: Who knows but he might conceal the same Fears they urg&rsquo;d?
And in short, he appear&rsquo;d so Resolute against all they could say,
that he brought them to his Beck. He sail&rsquo;d thence, keeping the
Channel, and about a League to the South-East, the <i>Indians</i>
show&rsquo;d him the way the Bearded Men took, of whom, after killing
many, they, as was afterwards known, sav&rsquo;d one <i>Catherine</i>,
and a Boy, both <i>English</i>, who <span class="marginnote"><i>Account
of</i> Drake&rsquo;<i>s</i> <i>Passage</i>.</span> still liv&rsquo;d
among those wild Beasts, which they were more like than Rational
Creatures. Somewhat farther in another Island, which the <i>Indians</i>
said was call&rsquo;d <i>Puchachailgua</i>, full of extraordinary high
grey Rocks, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name=
"pb81">81</a>]</span>bearded Men again fought the Natives without
Success. They went on to another Island Nam&rsquo;d
<i>Capitloilgua</i>, on the Coast call&rsquo;d <i>Cayrayxaxiilgua</i>.
<i>Sarmiento</i> did not change the Ancient Names of Countries, when he
could learn them. They were sufficiently dismay&rsquo;d in the next
they came at, thinking they were Imbay&rsquo;d; but presently after
they took Heart again, at the Sight of the Channel, which begins at the
Mouth called <i>Xaultegua</i>, and it widen&rsquo;d, bringing them out
to a most spacious Sea, full of thousands of Islands. Passing by, in
Sight of one of them, they perceiv&rsquo;d high Smokes; and the Captive
<i>Indians</i> began to Weep, and they saw it was for Fear of the
Natives, expressing that they were Giants, and fought desperately. Our
Men encourag&rsquo;d them, giving them to understand that they should
be able to deal with those People. They went ashore on that Country,
which is call&rsquo;d <i>Tinquichisgua</i>. <i>Sarmiento</i>
alter&rsquo;d it, in Honour of the Cross he <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Several Islands.</i></span> erected there, calling it,
the Island of the Cross. There he saw Abundance of Whales, Wolves, and
other Sea-Monsters, and great Clods of Snow, on the Waves. He made
ready his Cannon, and small Arms, providing against both Pirates and
Natives, for he expected to find the <i>English</i> possessed of the
Land. From that Time he stood upon his Guard, and no Man quitted his
Arms. They went on to a third Island, which is the biggest, heard
Humane Voices, and saw some <i>Piraguas</i>, with the People that
cry&rsquo;d out, who were crossing from one Island to another. Our Men
drew near in the Boat to take a View, and all of them put into a clean
Harbour, whence they discover&rsquo;d a Town, not Barbarous, but Decent
and Lofty, like ours in <i>Europe</i>, and abundance of People, who
having sunk the <i>Piraguas</i>, <span class="marginnote"><i>Populous
Islands.</i></span> and standing on the Mountains, with their Arms in
their Hands, call&rsquo;d to our Men from a Wood, to Land, as ours did
them to draw near the Sea. Among the Trees appear&rsquo;d many more of
those Islanders, with Bows and Arrows, as if they intended to fall on.
This made our Men discharge some Muskets at them, the Noise whereof so
terrify&rsquo;d the <i>Indian</i> Women, that they set up hideous
Shrieks, and therefore the <i>Spaniards</i> forbore Firing, for fear of
losing all hopes of gaining their Affections. By this time the Ship
which had been Cruizing up and down, came into the Harbour.
<i>Sarmiento</i> made a Gun ready, and the Boat came Aboard, Towing a
<i>Piragua</i> after it. Having writ the Instrument of Possession,
tho&rsquo; he had not inquir&rsquo;d into the Government of the
Inhabitants of that great Town, he Landed on the Shore, whence is
discover&rsquo;d a vast high Mountain, all white with aged Snow, and
encompass&rsquo;d with Rocks. Ancient Relations call&rsquo;d it
<i>Orlanro</i>&rsquo;s Bell, he being one of <i>Magellan</i>&rsquo;s
Companions. He Sail&rsquo;d on to 54 Degrees Latitude, at the Point he
call&rsquo;d of S. <i>Isidorus</i>. Near to it the Natives call&rsquo;d
out to him, and coming up to our Men, Embrac&rsquo;d them familiarly.
<span class="marginnote"><i>Tractable</i> Indians.</span>
<i>Sarmiento</i>, besides Hawks-Bels, and other Toys, sent them Bisket
and Flesh from the Ships. They sat down to Converse, by Signs, with the
Ensign, the Pilot, and Eight other Christians, signifying, that they
were pleas&rsquo;d with their Friendship, and those rich Gifts; and
gave such confuse Tokens of the <i>English</i> having pass&rsquo;d that
way, as the others had done. Then they return&rsquo;d to their Huts,
and the Admiral having taken Possession, and found the Latitude to be
53 Degrees, and 40 Minutes, advanc&rsquo;d in sight of the Coast, which
eight Leagues from thence lies flat with the Sea, and forms a Shore of
white Sand. Before he came to it he Discover&rsquo;d a prodigious high
burning Mountain, cover&rsquo;d with Snow; where the Fire and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span>the Snow seem, out of natural Courtesy, to Respect
one another, and to confine within themselves their Force, and Effects;
for neither is the one Quench&rsquo;d, nor the other Melted by their
near Neighbourhood. The Channel carry&rsquo;d him to the Point he
call&rsquo;d of <i>S. Anne</i>, in 53 Degrees and a half of Latitude.
He took possession, and rais&rsquo;d a heap of Stones, at the Foot of a
Cross, and left a Letter written with Charcole-Dust, which he thought
incorruptible, in the Shards of an Earthen Vessel, well Pitch&rsquo;d,
among those Stones. In it he declared to all Nations, That those Lands
and Seas belong&rsquo;d to the King of <i>Spain</i>, and by what Title
he held them. In the same Letter, he left Orders for his Vice-Admiral,
to return to <i>Peru</i>, and give the Viceroy an Account of all that
happen&rsquo;d, till they discover&rsquo;d the Streight. <span class=
"marginnote">Indian <i>Presents</i>.</span> The Ship steer&rsquo;d off
with the Ebb, and the <i>Indians</i> when it was gone came down with
their Wives and Children, and a Present of great pieces of Sea Wolves,
stinking Meat, Sea Foul, call&rsquo;d <i>Minnos</i>, which are White
and Yellowish, <i>Murtina</i>, a sort of Fruit like Cherries, and bits
of Flint, bor&rsquo;d through and Painted, in a small Box of Gold and
Silver. Being ask&rsquo;d, what that was for, and they answering, <i>To
strike Fire</i>, one of them took some Feathers he brought, and with
them lighted it, as if it were Tinder. A little before, when our Men
made a Fire to melt the Pitch, for securing the Vessel the Letter was
in, which was left stopp&rsquo;d at the Foot of the Cross, the Flame
spread upon the Mountain, and rais&rsquo;d a Smoke. The <i>Indians</i>
believing they were Fires made by those so much dreaded Enemies of
theirs, went away and could not be stopp&rsquo;d by any means; nor was
their Fear groundless, for they answer&rsquo;d immediatly in the
opposite Island, with great Smokes. The River which falls into the Sea
at the Point <i>Sarmiento</i> call&rsquo;d <i>S. John</i>&rsquo;s; and
the Streight dividing these Islands, which is the very Old one of
<i>Magellan</i>, look&rsquo;d and sought after with so much Danger, he
nam&rsquo;d of <i>The Mother of God</i>, changing its first
Appellation, that through this Devotion she may obtain of her Son the
Salvation of those numberless Provinces, extending the Voice of his
Gospel to them, that it might reach the Ears of so many Souls, most of
which are Ignorant of their own Immortality, without knowing any more
than common Nature has taught them.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Possession taken.</i></span>
<i>Sarmiento</i> was so well pleas&rsquo;d with having thus
express&rsquo;d his Devotion, that when he return&rsquo;d to
<i>Spain</i>, he intreated the Kings, to direct that Streight to be
generally so call&rsquo;d, and his Majesties Orders. The Possession of
this so remarkable Place was taken with extraordinary Joy, inserting in
the Instrument the Clause of Pope <i>Alexander</i> the 6th&rsquo;s
Bull, the Title that gives the Kings of <i>Castile</i>, and the Limits
assigned by the Line he drew through both the Poles of the World, as
Gods Vicar. <i>F. Guadramiro</i> said Mass, and they all heard it
devoutly, considering it was the first offer&rsquo;d up in that Place
by Man to his Creator. It was intended as a Thanksgiving, and they all
took Courage to undertake any difficult Enterprize. They saw the Track
of Tigers, and Lions, and also White and Grey Parrots, with Red Heads;
and they heard the sweet Notes of Goldfinches, and other Birds. Holding
on their Course along the Channel, with excessive hot Weather, they
came into a Bay, that was cover&rsquo;d with white Weeds, and
Anchor&rsquo;d at the Point, on which a Company of Giants immediatly
appear&rsquo;d, who call&rsquo;d out to them, lifting up their Hands
Unarm&rsquo;d; our Men imitated their Actions, which denoted Peace on
both sides. They being come to the <i>Boat</i>, which was Guarded by
ten Musketeers, the Ensign leap&rsquo;d Ashore, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span>with
four others. The Giants made Signs to him to lay down his
Leading-Staff, and then they withdrew, to the place where they had hid
their Bows and Arrows. The Ensign did as they directed, and then
shew&rsquo;d them the Toys and Gifts he design&rsquo;d for them. This
withheld them, but still they were jealous, wherefore our Men supposing
their jealousy proceeded from what they had suffer&rsquo;d before, and
guessing they had receiv&rsquo;d some dammage from the <i>English</i>
Pyrate, to be the better enform&rsquo;d of it, ten of our men fell upon
one of the Giants, whom they took; but had enough to <span class=
"marginnote"><i>A Giant Taken.</i></span> do to secure him. The others
running to their Arms, return&rsquo;d so quick upon the
<i>Spaniards</i>, that they had scarce time to get into their Boat.
They shot their Arrows, which flying thick, and our Men taking care to
avoid them, they dropt two Muskets. The Steward of the Ship was shot in
the Eye with an Arrow. The <i>Indian</i> they took was a Giant even
among the other Giants, and the Relation says, he look&rsquo;d to them
like one of the <i>Cyclops</i>. Other Relations assure us, each of
these Giants is above three Yards high, and they are proportionably
spread and brawny. Being brought into the Ship, he was extraordinary
melancholy, and tho&rsquo; they offer&rsquo;d him the best they had to
Eat, he would take nothing all that Day. They set Sail, crossing
Channels, and passing by Islands, in most of which they saluted them
with Smokes. In the narrowest Part, which they call&rsquo;d of <i>Our
Lady of Grace</i>, through which they must pass of Necessity, and is
<span class="marginnote"><i>Other</i> Indians.</span> in 53 Degrees and
a half Latitude, <i>Sarmiento</i> was of Opinion, Forts might be
erected on the two Capes to secure the Passage. They made haste
thro&rsquo; it, and again saw the Natives on another Point of Land,
calling out, and shaking their Cloaks, or Woolly Blankets.
<i>Sarmiento</i> went to them with eighteen Soldiers<span class="corr"
id="xd21e9456" title="Source: ,">.</span> Only four <i>Indians</i>
appear&rsquo;d with Bows and Arrows, and making Signs of Peace with
their Hands, said, <i>Xiitote</i>, which, as was afterwards known,
signifies Brothers. They posted themselves on a rising Ground, and when
the <i>Spaniards</i> were landed, made Signs to them for one of our Men
to come to them. One went unarm&rsquo;d, with some Gifts, as
Glass-Beads, Hawks-Bels and Combs, which they receiv&rsquo;d pointing
to him to go down again. He did so, and the Ensign went up in his
stead, obliging them with other Presents. They accepted of them, and
yet neither they, nor any Courtesie could dispel their Jealousie.
<i>Sarmiento</i> left them, to avoid provoking them, and going up the
Mountain another way, to view the Ridge, Plains, and Channels, the four
Archers appear&rsquo;d before him, and without any Provocation
receiv&rsquo;d, but on the contrary after receiving the aforesaid
Gifts, they furiously assaulted our Men, wounding the General with two
Arrows in the Side, and betwixt his Eyes; and another Soldier had an
Eye put out. The rest of the <i>Spaniards</i> covering themselves with
their Bucklers ran at them, but the Giants fled up the Country so
swiftly, that a Musket Ball would <span class="corr" id="xd21e9475"
title="Source: scare">scarce</span> over-take them. This Action seems
to verifie the Cowardice the Authors of Fabulous Books, commonly
call&rsquo;d <i>Romances</i>, ascribe to their Giants. <i>Sarmiento</i>
view&rsquo;d the Land, call&rsquo;d it <i>Nuestra Senora del Valle</i>,
or <i>Our Lady of the Vale</i>, discovering betwixt two spacious
Ridges, some delightful Plains, numerous Towns, lofty Buildings, Towers
and Pinacles, and to his Thought sumptuous Temples of so Majestick an
Appearance, that he scarce believ&rsquo;d his own Eyes, and
judg&rsquo;d it an imaginary City.</p>

<p class="first">These Endeavours us&rsquo;d by <i>Spain</i> to shut
out the Monsters of Heresy, dispell&rsquo;d the Dread spread abroad by
<i>Drake</i>, and his <span class="marginnote"><i>Reasons for
Digressions.</i></span> Example in the North and South Seas. And since
his coming to <i>Ternate</i>, oblig&rsquo;d us to write all these
Particulars, we could not, once they began to have any Place in this
Relation, forbear making it perfect by delivering the Success of them.
A compleat History is the Witness of Times, the Light of Truth, the
Life of Memory, and in fine the Mistress of Life. Therefore, to perform
the Duty incumbent on it from such important Employments, it is not to
spare any notable Digressions; especially when they deviate but little
from the main Subject, and have some Connexion with it. This here is
due to a most prudent Action of King <i>Philip</i> IId. and his
Ministers; and shows his Catholick Indignation against Sectaries, and
his Zeal for preserving the Faithful of his <i>Indies</i> untainted,
and improving the Disposition in the Souls of Idolaters, towards
drawing them to the Faith. It demonstrates how he compass&rsquo;d the
whole World by Means of his Commanders, that he might introduce the
said Faith in all Corners thereof; to the Reputation of his
Watchfulness in the Service of this Mistical Empire, which is now
Militant, in order to its being Triumphant. For this Reason it is
absolutely Necessary, not to conceal <i>Sarmiento</i>&rsquo;s
Resolution, nor to leave him in those remote Seas, till we have brought
him back to <i>Spain</i>, and then we will return to the <i>Molucco</i>
Islands, which were in the mean while busy about their own Destruction.

<p><i>Sarmiento</i> did not go up to the great City he discover&rsquo;d
at a Distance, because he would not depart from his Ship, to which he
return&rsquo;d, leaving us still desirous to be throughly
satisfi&rsquo;d of so strange a Thing. By the Way he found two
extraordinary long Cloaks, or Barbarian Blankets, made of Sheep-Skins,
with the Wooll on, and a pair of Shoes made of raw Hides to bind about
the Feet, which the <i>Indians</i> could not carry off, thro&rsquo; the
fearful Precipitation of their Flight. They continu&rsquo;d their
Discovery, <span class="marginnote"><i>South Coast.</i></span> and the
Wind oblig&rsquo;d them to strike over to the Southern Coast, five
Leagues distant from <i>Our Lady of the Vale</i>; and tho&rsquo; the
cold Winds blew, they found this Country more Temperate than the
others. It is inhabited by proper People, has wild and tame Cattel, and
Game, as was declar&rsquo;d by <i>Philip</i>, so they call&rsquo;d an
<i>Indian</i> they brought over, in Honour to King <i>Philip</i>. It
produces Cotton, a certain Sign of its being Temperate; and Cinnamon,
by them call&rsquo;d <i>Cabea</i>. The Air is very serene, and the
Stars appear bright, so that they are plainly to be observ&rsquo;d,
lay&rsquo;d down, and describ&rsquo;d. <i>Sarmiento</i> says it is
useful in those Parts to observe the <i>Crozier</i>, which is 30
Degrees above the <i>Antartick</i> Pole, and that he made use of it,
for taking of Latitudes, as we do in our Hemisphere of the <i>North
Star</i>, <span class="marginnote"><i>Observations for
Sailors.</i></span> tho&rsquo; with another Sort of Computation. And in
Regard that the <i>Crozier</i> does not serve all the Year, he sought
out another <i>Polar Star</i>, nearer to the <i>Pole</i>, of a shorter
Computation, but general and perpetual; and he us&rsquo;d such
Industry, that he discover&rsquo;d, and ascertain&rsquo;d it by
Observations, and Experiments of several clear Nights. He settled the
Stars in the <i>Crozier</i>, and two other <i>Croziers</i>, and two
other <i>Polar Stars</i>, which take a very small Compass; this he did
for the common Benefit of curious Sailors. Notwithstanding all these
Tokens, and the Incouragement of humane Curiosity, no Man has ever gone
to those Towns, which had such promising Signs of Civility; tho&rsquo;
those rude Giants did not seem to confirm those Appearances of a
well-settled Country. <i>Sarmiento</i> ran along the Streight,
<span class="marginnote">Sarmiento <i>comes into the North
Sea</i>.</span> never ceasing to sound, and lay it down till he came to
a Cape, he call&rsquo;d, <i>Of the Holy Ghost</i>, from which to that
of the Virgin <i>Mary</i>, there are 110 Leagues from the South to the
North Sea. Here they began to order their Course with due Difference.
They saw Whales, and on the Shores, Thickets of several unknown Plants.
They ran thro&rsquo; Storms and Dangers, surprizing even to such
experienced Sailors as they were. They all vow&rsquo;d Offerings to
Churches, Alms, and Pilgrimages to Places of Devotion in <i>Spain</i>,
with other solemn Engagements, on which fearful Mortals in Danger,
devoutly ground and encourage their Hopes. The Tempest ceas&rsquo;d,
and on the 25th of <i>March</i>, about Midnight, <i>Sarmiento</i> saw a
low white Rainbow, opposite to the Moon, which was moving against it;
and it was occasion&rsquo;d by Repercussion of her Rays, which fell by
Refraction on the opposite Clouds. He says, That neither he nor any
other Person, ever saw, heard, or read of the like; but by his good
Leave, in <i>Albericus Vespusius</i>&rsquo;s Epitome of Voyages, we
read that the same happen&rsquo;d in the Year 1501, in that same Place,
where both of them taking the Sun&rsquo;s Altitude, they found him in
23 Degrees large, which is as good as 15 Leagues. This Day they were
within the Tropick of <i>Capricorn</i>. Proceeding forward, they lost
their Reckoning, and the Hopes of recovering it, for Want of
Mathematical Instruments; but on the first of <i>April</i>,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=
"pb86">86</a>]</span>1580, at Night, they discover&rsquo;d, and
observ&rsquo;d the <i>Polar-Star</i> of the Triangle in 21 Degrees; and
on the 10th of the same Month, they saw the <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Anchors at the Island</i> Ascention.</span> Island of
the <i>Ascention</i>, at eight Leagues Distance. They anchor&rsquo;d
there, found Water, and saw several Crosses, erected by some
<i>Portugueses</i>, who in their Way to <i>India</i>, were cast away
there by a Storm, and the Living, out of Devotion, set them up on the
Graves of those that dy&rsquo;d. On one of them they found a Board
nail&rsquo;d, with this Inscription, Don John de Castel Rodrigro,
<i>Commodore, arriv&rsquo;d here with five India Ships, on the 13th of
May</i>, 1576. Near to it, <i>Sarmiento</i> set up another, as a
Memorial, that the first Ship coming from <i>Peru</i>, touch&rsquo;d
there, having pass&rsquo;d thro&rsquo; the Streight from the South to
the North-Sea, on the King&rsquo;s Account, with the Occasion of his
Voyage. This Island abounds in Sharks, which are <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Ravenous Birds.</i></span> Sea-Monsters, Fish, and a
Sort of such greedy and troublesome Fowl, that they make at whatsoever
they see. They took the Ensigns Hat off his Head, to snatch away a
Letter he had stuck in it. He sav&rsquo;d his Hat, by clapping up his
Hand immediately, but lost the Letter, which they pull&rsquo;d away by
force; and afterwards they saw a Fray in the Air, the others
endeavouring to take it from that Harpy, which first snatch&rsquo;d it
away. This Island lies in 7 Degrees and a half of South Latitude, and
it is very observeable, that tho&rsquo; the <i>Spaniards</i> were very
attentive to their Compass, and took so many Precautions for their
Security, yet such was the Force of the several Currents, that when
they thought they were 60 Leagues from <i>Pernambuco</i> East and West,
at the River of <i>Virtues</i>, on the Coast of <i>Brazil</i>, they
found themselves 400 Leagues to the Eastward; so that the Currents
deceiv&rsquo;d, and drove them 340 Leagues from the Point they had
settled by the Degree of Latitude. <i>Sarmiento</i> discourses largely
upon this Effect, charging the Sea-Charts with Falshood, and being
ignorantly laid down. Dreadful Tempests ensu&rsquo;d, till on the 28th
of <i>April</i>, on the Coast of <i>Guinea</i> he discover&rsquo;d
<i>Sierra Liona</i>, abounding in Gold, and Blacks. Then the Islands
they call of <i>Idols</i>, and beyond them those of <i>Vixagaos</i>,
inhabited by stout Black Archers, who shoot poison&rsquo;d Arrows,
wherewith, such as are wounded, presently dye raving. On the 8th of
<i>May</i> they all fell sick on the Coast of <i>Guinea</i>, of Fevers,
Lameness, Swellings, and Imposthumations in their Gums, which in that
Country prove Mortal, by Reason of the Excessive Heat, and then for
Want of Water; but Heaven reliev&rsquo;d them with seasonable Rain.
When they labour&rsquo;d to make the Islands of <i>Cabo Verde</i> for
some Refreshment, the Winds drove them off. They bore up without
finding Land, or any Ship, till on the 22d of <i>May</i>, being in 15
Degrees 40 Minutes of North Latitude, they descry&rsquo;d two Sail.
<i>Sarmiento</i> believ&rsquo;d they had been <i>Portugueses</i>, and
was desirous to make up to hale them; but upon better Observation
perceiv&rsquo;d, the one was a Tall Ship, the other a Sloop, both of
them <i>French</i>, who pursu&rsquo;d and endeavour&rsquo;d to get to
Windward of him. The Sloop came foremost to view our Ship, which made
good its Advantage. When they <span class="marginnote"><i>Fight with
the French</i><span class="corr" id="xd21e9746" title=
"Not in source">.</span></span> were come in Sight of the Island of
<i>Santiago</i>, the <i>French</i> held up a Naked Sword, and then
fir&rsquo;d some Shot. The <i>Spaniards</i> answer&rsquo;d with their
Muskets, which was then done by both Sides, and several <i>French</i>
Men fell, tho&rsquo; on our Side never a Man was kill&rsquo;d, but some
wounded, and then they fled more swiftly than they had pursu&rsquo;d.
Those on the Island beheld <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href=
"#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>the Ingagement, and thinking it had
been Counterfeit, and both the Ships <i>French</i>, they stirr&rsquo;d
not out to Succour either. When the Pirate was quite fled, a
<i>Caravel</i> of <i>Algarve</i> arriv&rsquo;d coming from
<i>Portugal</i>, which discover&rsquo;d the Pirate&rsquo;s Name, and
Strength; declaring he had 85 Men in the Ship, and 25 in the Sloop, and
among them a <i>Portuguese</i> Pilot. That he had plunder&rsquo;d four
other Ships, and the said <i>Caravel</i>, at Cape <i>Blanco</i>, on the
Coast of <i>Africk</i>; and at the Island of <i>May</i>, not far from
<i>Santiago</i>, had sunk another <i>Caravel</i>, belonging to the
Royal Navy, which was sailing for <i>Brazil</i>, in order to People
<i>Paraguay</i>; where the <i>English</i> had of late Years built
Towns, intermarrying with, and being attracted by the Love, and
Children they had by the <i>Tapuyer Indian</i> Women.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Sarmiento <i>at</i> Cabo Verde.</span>
<i>Sarmiento</i> Landed at <i>Cabo Verde</i>, the Custom-House of which
City yearly is worth to the King 100000 Ducats. There are always in it
20000 Blacks, because of the settled Trade for them. Before he
Anchor&rsquo;d, there came Boats from the Shore, to view his Ship, and
he telling them, he came from <i>Peru</i>, through the Streights of
<i>Magellan</i>, they were amaz&rsquo;d. They return&rsquo;d to give an
Account to their Governor <i>Gaspar de Andrade</i>, and told him, That
those that came in the Ship, were Men of several Shapes,
Deform&rsquo;d, and Ill-look&rsquo;d, and others with long tangled Hair
and Locks. These were some <i>Indians</i> of <i>Peru</i> and
<i>Chile</i>. As for the Rest <i>Sarmiento</i> has these Words, <i>As
to our being Ill-look&rsquo;d, they did not wrong us; for besides that
we had no effeminate Countenances, the Powder and Sweat of our Volleys
of small Shot, a little before, had not set us off to any Advantage;
and, in short, we had more mind to some Water than to look like
Beaus.</i> However, neither he nor his Men went Ashore, till they had
satisfy&rsquo;d a Pratick Master that none of them were infected with
the Plague. The next Day they Landed bare-Foot, in Procession, with
Crosses, and Images, repairing to the Church of our Lady of the Rosary,
where they gave Thanks, Alms, and other effects of their Vows, with
extraordinary Joy; for every Storm is so much Honour, when recounted in
safe Harbour. They Confess&rsquo;d, and receiv&rsquo;d the Blessed
Sacrament at a Mass they had Vow&rsquo;d to cause to be said. The
Governor, Don <i>Bartholomew Leytao</i>, Entertain&rsquo;d, and made
much of them, tho&rsquo; at first he would not believe they had
pass&rsquo;d the Streight. The Sick were Cured, and the Ship and Boat
which were much shatter&rsquo;d, re-fitted. The main Design of this
Voyage, which was to Fight <i>Drake</i>, and provide the proper Defence
against the Designs of the Enemy, had not been compass&rsquo;d; and
therefore <i>Sarmiento</i>, having Fought the <i>French</i> Ship, and
Sloop, which appear&rsquo;d again, alarming that Coast, and both of
them flying back with all speed, after being Shatter&rsquo;d and
Beaten, to the Island <i>Mayo</i>, or of <i>May</i>, the common Shelter
of Robbers; He redoubled his Watchfulness, and went on to get
Intelligence of the <i>English</i>, as well those that pass&rsquo;d the
Streight with <i>Drake</i>, as of those new Planters in <i>Brazil</i>,
or <i>Paraguay</i>; as also of the Inclination of the Subjects of the
Crown of <i>Portugal</i>, to submit to King <i>Philip</i>, or Don
<i>Antony</i>. A Pilot of <i>Algarve</i> inform&rsquo;d him, That the
<span class="marginnote"><i>Intelligence he receives.</i></span> Year
before, betwixt <i>Ayamonte</i> and <i>Tavira</i>, two <i>English</i>
Merchants, speaking of the <i>Indies</i>, assured him, that
<i>Drake</i> was gone thro&rsquo; into the <i>South Sea</i>; and by the
Time, the News agreed with what the <i>Indians</i> of the Streight had
signify&rsquo;d to him by Signs; and that he arriv&rsquo;d safe in
<i>England</i>, with two Ships fraught with Gold and Silver of that
notable Robbery, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name=
"pb88">88</a>]</span>which he presented to the Queen. She fitted out
five other Ships, with three Years Provision, to return to the
Streights of <i>Magellan</i>, to seek out those that had been lost
there; and <i>Drake</i> eight more. That the first five were already
gone in <i>Decemb.</i> last. That the Merchants had entrusted him with
that Secret, taking him for a <i>Portuguese</i>, and who, as such,
would not discover it to the <i>Spaniards</i>. By the <i>French</i> he
was informed, That as soon as they had brought off some Ships with
Blacks from <i>Castro Vedre</i>, they would go over to the Island
<i>Margarita</i>, and thence to the North-ward, from the Island of
<i>Santo Domingo</i> to <i>Yaguana</i>, whence they came not above four
Months since, Loaded with Hides, and Sugar. That they had kill&rsquo;d
Captain <i>Barbudo</i>, in the Island <i>Margarita</i>, in Revenge for
the <i>English</i> he had slain. That having taken the Governor of
<i>Brazil</i>, they again set him at Liberty. That all their Pilots are
<i>Portugueses</i>. He was also told by others who came from thence,
and by Captains of Reputation, who were <span class=
"marginnote">English <i>in</i> Paraguay.</span> returning thither, that
in the Bay of <i>Paraguay</i>, near <i>Rio de Janeyro</i>, which is in
21 Degrees, 12 Minutes South Latitude, there had been for eight Years
last past, Colonies of <i>English</i> among the <i>Tapujers</i>; with
whom for the three last Years, the <i>Portuguese</i> were at War, and
had kill&rsquo;d most of them.</p>
<p>That it is suppos&rsquo;d the Natives, who are Man-Eaters, had
devour&rsquo;d most of those that fled up the Country. He pick&rsquo;d
up other Intelligence from <i>England</i>, concerning their Navies,
their Colonies in those Parts, and Design of Usurping the
<i>Molucco</i> Islands with all their Strength, and to render
themselves Invincible Masters of the Spice. They dispatch&rsquo;d a
Boat, with these Advices to the Viceroy of <i>Peru</i>; for
<i>Sarmiento</i> could not return himself by the way of <i>Brazil</i>
and <i>Paraguay</i>, because the force of the Currents had drove him
away into the Main Sea, East-ward. Before his Departure, <span class=
"marginnote">Sarmiento <i>Strangles his Ensign, and Punishes
others</i>.</span> he caus&rsquo;d his Ensign to be Strangled, as a
Traytor to his King, to the Dishonour of his Post, and an Obstructor of
the Discovery. Two other Soldiers he Bannish&rsquo;d, one of them from
the <i>Indies</i>, and shew&rsquo;d Severity to some of the Company, on
Account of the same Crime, which, it was believ&rsquo;d, had not been
so fully prov&rsquo;d upon them, as is requisite for inflicting the
usual Punishment.</p>
<p>From this Port he sail&rsquo;d to the Westward, till he came to the
Channel between the Island <i>Fuego</i> and that of <i>Santiago</i>,
where one of the Ships that came out with him stay&rsquo;d. Steering
Norwest, one Point over or under, <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Advice-Boat sent the Viceroy of</i> Peru.</span> for
that is the Course to the Island <i>S. Anton</i>, he thence
dispatch&rsquo;d the Advice Boat for the Viceroy of <i>Peru</i>, with
eight Men, commanded by <i>Ferdinand Alonso</i>. In thirteen Days more
he pass&rsquo;d betwixt the Island <i>Graciosa</i>, one of the
<i>Azores</i>, small, but fruitful, and populous, and that of <i>S.
George</i>, in which he saw prodigious high Fires. Those he afterwards
found verified <span class="marginnote"><i>Conflagration in the Island
of</i> S. George.</span> by the Bishop, at <i>Angra</i>, where he
resides. That on the first of <i>June</i> that same Year, there were
dreadful Earthquakes in the Island of <i>S. George</i>, Voices of
Devils were heard, and among other wonderful Effects, the Earth
open&rsquo;d in three Places, whence Streams of Fire ran as far as the
Sea. Those continu&rsquo;d, and seven more broke out, casting forth as
many Rivulets of Liquid Fire; one of which ran round an Hermitage, and
nine Men running to save some Bee-Hives from being burnt, another Mouth
open&rsquo;d, which swallow&rsquo;d seven of them, and sing&rsquo;d the
other two. So much Ashes fell like Rain upon the Earth, that it was
cover&rsquo;d a Span deep, and in short, all <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>the
Island was on Fire. <i>Sarmiento</i> held on his Course, and on the
18th of <i>June</i>, arriv&rsquo;d at the City <i>Angra</i>, on the
Island <i>Tercera</i>, the Chief of the <i>Azores</i>, where also came
in a Ship from the Town of <i>Bernambuco</i>, and another from <i>Baya
de todos <span class="corr" id="xd21e10095" title=
"Source: of">os</span> Santos</i>, in <i>Brazil</i>. These being
ask&rsquo;d, What they knew of the <i>English</i>, assur&rsquo;d him,
That in <i>November</i> last past there came five White Men, with
fifteen <i>Indians</i>, who were going to <i>Isleos</i>, and the
<i><span class="corr" id="xd21e10116" title=
"Source: Portuguse">Portuguese</span></i> Towns by Land; and going
along the Shore, they on a sudden, at <i>Rio de las Cuentas</i>,
lighted upon an <i>English</i> Sloop. Seven of the <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Some</i> English <i>in</i> Brazil.</span> Men were
ashore drying their Sails, and as soon as they saw the Travellers they
fled. The <i>Portuguese</i> persisted pursuing them; but the
<i>English</i> letting fly some Arrows, held on their Flight, two of
them up the Mountain, and the other five along the Coast, till they got
into the Sloop. They cut their Cables, and left behind them two large
Carriages for Guns.</p>
<p>The Travelers desir&rsquo;d them to come ashore, and offer&rsquo;d
them Meat, and all other Necessaries, assuring them they meant no Harm.
They answer&rsquo;d, they would not come, and show&rsquo;d Muskets,
Cross-bows and Pikes, pointing a small Gun, to fire at them. It was
then Ebb, and they departed six Leagues from thence, to sail near the
River <i>de las Cuentas</i>. That at the Island <i>Cape</i>,
over-against <i>Camamu</i>, another <i>Portuguese</i> Ship, that knew
nothing of this Sloop, lighted on it, when there were only three
<i>English</i> Men left in her, the rest being kill&rsquo;d ashore,
with Arrows by the Natives. In short, the Sloop was cast away, five Men
of it being taken, who declar&rsquo;d, that it came with a Squadron of
ten Ships, in which a certain great <i>Englishman</i> <span class=
"marginnote"><i>An</i> English <i>Squadron</i>.</span> pass&rsquo;d the
Streights of <i>Magellan</i>. That they return&rsquo;d thence Coasting
along, to plant a Colony in the most convenient Place for their
Purpose, the Admiral having 500 Men aboard for that End. Four Hundred
of them were Soldiers, the rest Seamen, and other Mechanicks. That all
this Squadron Anchor&rsquo;d in an Island of <i>Cainbals</i>, or
Man-Eaters, and a Storm rising, nine of them sail&rsquo;d away, but the
Admiral not being able to get from her Anchors time enough, was Cast
away, none being sav&rsquo;d but those that came <span class=
"marginnote"><i>The Admiral cast-away.</i></span> in the Sloop, and
they escap&rsquo;d by being then gone to Water. One of these five was
35 Years of Age, and an able Mathematitian. He affirm&rsquo;d, That
those who escap&rsquo;d the Storm, would soon return to the Coast of
<i>Brazil</i>, with a numerous Fleet. Among other Particulars, he told
them, that they found an Inscription with the King of
<i>Spain</i>&rsquo;s Arms, in that part of the Island <i>Cananca</i>,
where they were, which their Commander in chief took away, and set up
in the Place of it another, with those of <i>England</i>. Besides all
this, three of those Ships that escap&rsquo;d the Storm, coming before
the <i>Portuguese</i> Town of <i>Rio de Janeiro</i>, to make the Cape,
and find out the other six, the Governor of that Place, sent out four
<i>Canoes</i> to take Cognisance of them, which on a sudden fell in
with another Long-Boat <span class="corr" id="xd21e10202" title=
"Source: belongging">belonging</span> to the <i>English</i>, who, as
soon as they spy&rsquo;d the <i>Canoes</i>, made away, but could not do
it so fast as to save all. They took Three, and the Governor sent them
to <i>Bahia</i>; but the Ships made away with all their Sails. The
Prisoners own&rsquo;d, That in case they met with their Ships at the
Cape, they <span class="marginnote">English <i>at</i> Brazil.</span>
were resolv&rsquo;d to go to <i>Parayba</i>, or <i>Pernambuco</i>. In
other Respects they agreed with the Account given by those in the
Sloop. The <i>English</i> arriv&rsquo;d at <i>Brazil</i> about
<i>November</i>, 1579, at the same Time that <i>Sarmiento</i> was
seeking <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name=
"pb90">90</a>]</span>for the Streight; and this agrees with the confuse
Signs the Brutish <i>Indians</i> of those Parts made to him, as he
Touch&rsquo;d on their Coasts. His chief Care being to enquire into
these Matters, he was inform&rsquo;d by the <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Ship of theirs cast-away.</i></span> <i>Corregidor</i>,
that is the Governor in Civil Affairs of <i>Angra</i>, that on the
second of <i>November</i>, that same Year, another <i>English</i> Ship
was Cast-away at <i>Gualva</i>, a Town two Leagues distant from that
City, with six Men in it, two whereof, and a Black were sav&rsquo;d. It
appear&rsquo;d there had been 300 Men in the Ship, and much Wealth,
which was thrown into the Sea, during the Storm. That they were going
to plant Colonies in <i>India</i>, and most of the Men dy&rsquo;d on
the Coast of <i>Guinea</i>; and perhaps this might be one of the nine
Ships aforesaid. The People of <i>Gualva</i> drew out of the Sea
fifteen heavy pieces of cast Iron Cannon, but could not get out several
others. The fifteen are of an extraordinary Magnitude, as it were for
some settled Fort. To conclude, he was inform&rsquo;d, and Time has
since verified it, that they were preparing in those Northern Parts to
rob us of the Treasure of Metals, and Spice there is in those
Countries, and in exchange to Introduce their Sects. The final Success
of both the <i>Spanish</i> and the <i>English</i> Admirals, was that
they arriv&rsquo;d safe in their respective Countries, forsaken
<span class="marginnote">Drake&rsquo;s <i>Treasure
seiz&rsquo;d.</i></span> by the Vice-Admirals. <i>Drake</i>
return&rsquo;d to <i>London</i>, with an immense Treasure, which the
Queen seiz&rsquo;d, alledging, That <i>Don Barnardino de Menoza</i>,
then the <i>Spanish</i> Embassador at that Court, demanded Restitution,
as belonging to his K. and the rest of it taken from his Subjects; but
she adjudg&rsquo;d it to her own Cofers, in Recompence for the Dammage
sustain&rsquo;d, when the <i>Spaniards</i> supported her Rebels in
<i>Ireland</i>. <i>Drake</i> was not enrich&rsquo;d by his Robberies,
nor did he gain any Reputation by his Actions; but on the contrary he
was slighted in <i>England</i>, either because they knew what he did
was not Honourable, or that generally a Man&rsquo;s own Country is
<span class="marginnote">Sarmiento <i>in</i> Spain.</span> ungrateful
to him. <i>Sarmiento</i> departing from <i>Angra</i> with a fair Wind,
discover&rsquo;d the Coast of <i>Spain</i> on the <i>7th</i> of
<i>August</i>, and arriv&rsquo;d at Cape <i>S. Vincent</i>, full of
Intelligence and News from so great a Part of the World, and of the
Designs of several Nations, and the Crown of <i>Portugal</i>. His
Arrival, and Account produc&rsquo;d the fitting out of other Fleets,
and fresh Preparations in <i>Spain</i>, and in the <i>Indies</i>, which
extended to the Relief of the remotest Parts. One of them was the
Reducing of <i>Ternate</i>, and the sending over one hundred
<i>Spanish</i> Families, arm&rsquo;d, provided and examin&rsquo;d, as
to Quality and Virtue, to be the first Inhabitant of those Desarts upon
the Streight. They carry&rsquo;d Tools, Arms, Instructions, and all
Necessaries to fortifie the narrow Parts of it. <i>Sarmiento</i> went
as Chief, and Governour of those Dominions. This Project prov&rsquo;d
unsuccessful, and in the general Opinion of all Men, it was through the
Fault of the Gen&eacute;ral <i>Sancho Flores</i>. Afterwards
<i>Sarmiento</i> was taken, and set at Liberty in <i>England</i> where
he had Conferences with the Queen and <i>Drake</i> upon this Subject,
whence he drew Information for the Execution of greater Designs.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>King</i> Henry <i>of</i> Portugal
<i>dyes</i>.</span> This Year King <i>Henry</i> Dy&rsquo;d in
<i>Portugal</i>, when he had Reign&rsquo;d but thirteen Months. Five
Governours had the Administration during the <i>Interregnum</i>, and
were disturb&rsquo;d by the Arming of <i>Don Antonio</i>, within the
Kingdom, and by King <i>Philip</i>&rsquo;s Forces already advancing
into the Frontiers. So that neither Government could do any more than
consult about the present Exigencies; which at that Time were neither
perfect Peace nor open War, there being Hopes that they would lay down
their Arms, and joyn <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91"
name="pb91">91</a>]</span>with their true Prince, whom the
<i>Portuguese</i> is wont to Love, as a Father, rather than as a King.
However there were some Troubles, and Commotions. Private Discord is an
inseparable incident to all Governments, and that draws the Thoughts of
Men after it, and is often the Original of general Calamities,
tho&rsquo; it be moderated, or justify&rsquo;d by a sincere Zeal.</p>
<p>King <i>Philip</i> enter&rsquo;d <i>Lisbon</i> supporting his Right
by his Power, and <span class="marginnote"><i>King</i> Philip
<i>the</i> II. <i>at</i> Lisbon.</span> whilst the other Provinces,
which compose that Monarchy in <i>Spain</i>, <i>Africk</i>,
<i>Asia</i>, and the <i>East-Indies</i> submitted to him, he
bestow&rsquo;d Favours, gave Laws, confirm&rsquo;d the Old, ratified
Priviledges, and gain&rsquo;d Affections by his Presence, and a General
Pardon, which he extended to those who had offended him. On the 15th of
<i>November</i> 1582, he swore to observe those Laws establish&rsquo;d
by his Predecessors, and particularly by King <i>Emanuel</i>, as then
next Heir to the Crowns of <i>Spain</i>, for himself and his Son,
Prince <i>Michael</i>, whom God took to a better Kingdom in his
Infancy. Those Laws were afterwards sworn to by King <i>Sebastian</i>,
and all of them imported, that all Honours, Employments, Benefices, and
the Management of the Revenue of the Crown, with all other Commands by
Sea and Land, in <i>Portugal</i>, <i>Africk</i>, <i>India</i>, the
Islands and all other Parts already conquered, or to be conquer&rsquo;d
by that Crown, shall be in the Hands of Natural born
<i>Portugueses</i>. And by the 24th Chapter of these Laws, it was
establish&rsquo;d, that in fitting out Fleets <span class=
"marginnote"><i>He Swears to maintain the Laws.</i></span> for
<i>India</i>, or otherwise for Defence of the Kingdom, or suppressing
of Pyrates, the King should take the necessary Measures with the
Kingdom of <i>Portugal</i>, though he should use the Assistance of his
Majesties other Dominions. They were sensible that this favourable Law,
without infringing the Antient Laws, made way for employing the Forces
of the Crown of <i>Castile</i>, in the Recovery, or Preservation of the
Kingdoms of the Eastern <i>Archipelago</i>, where at that Time the
Christians suffer&rsquo;d Martyrdom, without any Opposition. And the
King for the Recovery of <i>Ternate</i>, especially consider&rsquo;d
the Conveniency of the <i>Philippine</i> Islands, which lie more
opportune than <i>India</i>; the Justness of which Reflection has been
confirm&rsquo;d by the Event.</p>
<p><i>India</i> at this Time was govern&rsquo;d by the Viceroy
<i>Fernan Tellez</i>, to whom King <i>Philip</i> the second Writ,
representing how favourable an Opportunity he had to do God good
Service, to secure the Tranquility of Christendom, and settle Peace,
which inestimable Advantages would be owing to his Fidelity and Care,
if through them those Provinces should be united to the Monarchy,
without any Trouble, by continuing Loyal, and providing that the
Tributary Kings should do the same. He put him in Mind that Services
<span class="marginnote">India <i>submits to him</i>.</span> become the
more valuable by the surmounting of the greatest Difficulties, and gave
him good Hopes of a Reward, which would have been fulfill&rsquo;d, had
he come home to see the Effects of them and his Services. But <i>Fernan
Tellez</i> had no need of any such Promises, or of the Perswasions
which are as good as Commands, contain&rsquo;d in Letters from
Ministers of State, and sent with the King&rsquo;s Letter. These being
sent over Land, came <span class="marginnote">Tellez <i>the Viceroy
Loyal</i>.</span> to his Hands in six Months, and he either preserving,
or gaining their Affections had so much Forecast as to confirm the
King, Princes, and <i>Sangiacks</i>, who, in those remote Parts, pay
subjection to the Crown of <i>Portugal</i>; before he knew any thing of
the Orders sent him, or of the additional Estate the King was
pleas&rsquo;d to confer on him. By his Authority he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=
"pb92">92</a>]</span>disappointed some Projects of Confederacies, set a
foot for the recovering of their Former Liberty, hoping by the Example
of the King of <i>Ternate</i>, that the Revolutions in <i>Europe</i>
might turn to their Advantage. But in despight of these Contradictions
and Changes, <i>Fernan Tellez</i> so far prevailed, as that the
Religious Mendicants, and the <i>Jesuits</i>, continu&rsquo;d the
preaching of the Gospel, with such Fervour, that they defy&rsquo;d even
Tyranny it self. The Conversions of Idolater Princes are truly and
elegantly related in the Writings and Books of the Missions of the
Society, and other Ecclesiastical Histories; so that they excite, and
inflame Devotion in the Breasts of such as read them. There may be
seen, how the Truth was embrac&rsquo;d, with all possible Affection;
how hastily, and eagerly they learn&rsquo;d the Catechism; what
Rejoycings the Catechumens made on the Day they were baptiz&rsquo;d;
Queens, and Princesses worshipping the Images of Saints; and sweeping
the new Churches, and Chappels with their own Hands; with what
Attention, and Exactness they honour&rsquo;d the Ceremonies of the
Church, and lastly, how they frequented the Sacraments, and
improv&rsquo;d in Christianity.</p>
<p>All this was Persecuted, and Extirpated by the King of
<i>Ternate</i>; who was now so far from enduring any neighbouring
Empire, that he struck a Dread into the remotest; insomuch, that
tho&rsquo; they were all sensible they <span class="marginnote"><i>King
of</i> Bachian <i>kill&rsquo;d</i>.</span> ought in all good Policy to
support the Kingdoms of <i>Tydore</i> and <i>Bachian</i>, yet they
became lookers on, as it were on a Stage, to behold the Assaults given,
and the Cruelties acted at the Sieges. And in the latter of them,
whilst throughout <i>India</i> the Standards were display&rsquo;d in
submission to <i>Spain</i>, the King of <i>Ternate</i> enter&rsquo;d
<i>Bachian</i>, and press&rsquo;d on so vigorously, that he took the
Forts by main Force, and made the principal <i>Sangiacks</i> Prisoners.
At the Taking of the City of <i>Bachian</i>, the King of the Island was
slain in Fight, with all the <i>Portugueses</i> that assisted him; and
the Prince, his Son, taken, who was then a Christian, but soon after,
having taken an Oath of Fealty to the Conquerer, and Apostatiz&rsquo;d
from the True Religion, he was miserably Restor&rsquo;d to his Kingdom,
exchanging the Hopes of his Souls Salvation, for the Pernicious Fables
of the <i>Alcoran</i>, to which he has adhear&rsquo;d till this time;
tho&rsquo; in Temporals he now owns the sovereign Dominion of our King.
The War with the <i>Tydores</i> lasted longer, the two Navies fighting
with indifferent Success, and Victory changing sides, according
<span class="marginnote"><i>Molucco way of</i> Fighting.</span> to
various Accidents. These Princes method of making War depends on
Ambushes, and Stratagems, where Subtilty supplies the place of
Strength. It is rare that either side is much weakned; because as soon
as sensible of the others Advantage, the Weaker flyes, and reserves
himself for better Fortune; nor do they look upon it as Dishonourable
to fly, for in those Parts they have but rude Notions of the Laws of
Honour. The last Action, after they had sustain&rsquo;d the Siege with
extraordinary Magnanimity, was a Sally made by the <i>Portuguese</i>
and <i>Tydores</i> from the Fort, with much Order and Conduct,
Attacking the Enemies Camp with such Bravery, that <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Battle of</i> Tydores <i>and</i> Ternates.</span>
tho&rsquo; they were much superior in number, they could not stand the
Fury of the King of <i>Tydore</i>. The <i>Ternates</i> being put to
Flight, imbark&rsquo;d after a great Slaughter of their Men, and never
stopp&rsquo;d till they came to <i>Talangame</i>, so they call the
Harbour of <i>Ternate</i> on that side. The <i>Tydores</i>
pursu&rsquo;d, and being flush&rsquo;d with Victory despis&rsquo;d the
Succours the <i>Ternates</i> had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93"
href="#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>ready in that Place, which
Addition made them renew the Fight with fresh Vigour, and wrest the
Victory which then inclin&rsquo;d to the <i>Tydores</i>. These without
breaking their Order, retir&rsquo;d and imbark&rsquo;d; and hasting
back in their <i>Carcoas</i> came to <i>Tydore</i>, where they
fortify&rsquo;d themselves against what might happen. The King of
<i>Ternate</i> return&rsquo;d to this City in Triumphant Manner, making
a Show of some Prisoners.</p>
<p>The News of the Union of <i>Portugal</i> to <i>Castile</i>, was now
known throughout all those Eastern Parts, and so well receiv&rsquo;d,
that instead of offering at any Opposition, they all joyfully
submitted, hoping they should be protected by a more powerful Arm, than
they had been before. Nor were they deceiv&rsquo;d in their
Expectation, for, pursuant to what the King had sworn at <i>Lisbon</i>,
concerning the Fleets, for suppressing of Pyrates, and Garrisoning the
Coasts of <i>Africk</i>, he granted his Royal Order, for all the
Governours of the <i>Philippine</i> Islands to take Care to relieve the
<i>Moluccos</i>, and all other the Dominions in <i>India</i>, belonging
to the Crown of <i>Portugal</i>, making use of <i>New Spain</i>, and
all other Kingdoms subject to the Crown of <i>Castile</i>, there being
more conveniency for supplying them from thence, than even from
<i>India</i>.</p>
<p>The King of <i>Ternate</i>, being sensible of the Change of Times,
and how much greater Forces threatned him than before; and that he
should not be suffer&rsquo;d to reign, without submitting to a
Superior, he grew better advis&rsquo;d, <span class="marginnote">Nayque
<i>Embassador for</i> Spain.</span> and sent an Ambassador to
<i>Lisbon</i>. The Ambassador was <i>Cachil Nayque</i>, well known for
the Antiquity of his Family, and brave Actions. <i>Nayque</i> signifies
a <i>Tribune</i>, or Commander. He embark&rsquo;d with much Wealth of
those Parts, as Porcelane, <i>Chinese</i> Silks, Calico&rsquo;s and
Muslins, Spice, Fruit, Aromatick Woods and Barks, and Preserves of the
same; and passing between the Islands of <i>Pangicaz</i> and
<i>Manado</i>, near to that of <i>Celebes</i>, keeping off from the
Equinoctical, coasted it and cross&rsquo;d the Line <span class=
"marginnote"><i>His Voyage.</i></span> again, till he came to
<i>Borneo</i>. There he visited the King, who was at <i>Tayaopura</i>,
and deliver&rsquo;d him Letters from his Master, attempting by Word of
Mouth, to unite him to the <i>Molucco</i> Nation against the Crown of
<i>Spain</i>. Contenting himself with the first Hopes, he pass&rsquo;d
on betwixt <i>Cremato</i> and <i>Surato</i>, and cross&rsquo;d the
Islands <i>Pulo</i> and <i>Linga</i>, in sight of the greater
<i>Java</i>, thence thro&rsquo; the Streight of <i>Malaca</i>, by the
great Ones of <i>Banca</i> and <i>Bintam</i>, in the Port whereof were
then the 20 Ships, which are sent from <i>Sumatra</i> every Year,
loaded with Pepper. He barter&rsquo;d away much of what he had in his
own Ship, and propos&rsquo;d a general Revolt to all <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Streights of</i> Sincapura <i>and</i> Sabao.</span>
Nations. There are two Streights there; the one of <i>Sincapura</i>, so
call&rsquo;d from that City built on the Coast of <i>Malaca</i>; and
the other of <i>Sabao</i>, from an Island of that Name, and this leads
to <i>Sumatra</i>. <i>Nayque</i> steer&rsquo;d this Course, and soon
put into the Harbour which lies going out of the Channel.</p>
<p>This great Island, opposite to <i>Malaca</i>, and divided from it by
a Bay full <span class="marginnote">Sumatra
<i>describ&rsquo;d</i>.</span> of Ridges, of Rocks and Shoals, and
above a thousand smaller <i>Islands</i>, was formerly a
<i>Peninsula</i>, and contiguous to <i>Malaca</i>, as <i>Sicily</i> is
said to have been to <i>Italy</i>, Ancient Geographers call&rsquo;d it
<i>Trapobana</i>, the Modern <i>Sumatra</i>. The Ancients also
call&rsquo;d it, the <i>Golden Chersonesus</i>, and the most curious
Searchers into Antiquity, <i>Ophir</i>, whence <i>Solomon</i>
gather&rsquo;d that vast Mass of Treasure. According to the
<i>Portugueses</i> it is 80 <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href=
"#pb94" name="pb94">94</a>]</span>Leagues in Length, and 30 in Breadth.
(Here seems to be some Mistake in the Author, for the Island is well
known to be above 80 Leagues in Length.) <i>Italian</i> Writers say it
is 2100 in Circumference. The <i>Dutch</i>, who have traded and made
War there, do not contradict it, and all agree it is the largest in all
the East, and the most fruitful we know of. It lies thwarting from
North to South, in the <i>Torrid Zone</i>, and the Equinoctial Line
cuts it in the Middle; so that one Part falls to the Northern
Hemisphere, and takes up five Degrees, and the other to the Southern,
extending seven Degrees. This Island is, according to some, divided
into four Kingdoms; others say ten, and some 29; but we know of eight,
which are, <i>Pedir</i>, <i>Pacem</i>, <i>Achem</i>, <i>Camper</i>,
<i>Menancabo</i>, wealthy in Gold Mines, and <i>Zaude</i>; and up the
Inland the other two of <i>Andragide</i>, and <i>Auru</i>, the Natives
whereof are Idolaters and Man-Eaters. They devour, not only Strangers,
but their own Brothers, and Fathers. In short, among these barbarous
People, Hunger produces the same Effects as Passion. The King of
<i>Achem</i> is the most Powerful of them, and they all pay Homage to
the <span class="marginnote">Nayque <i>stirs up Princes to
revolt</i>.</span> Crown of <i>Portugal</i>. <i>Nayque</i>
enter&rsquo;d the Court of <i>Achem</i>, attended by his own Men, and
follow&rsquo;d by the Multitude of <i>Chinese</i>, <i>Japonese</i>,
<i>Malay</i>, <i>Persian</i>, and <i>Turkish</i> Merchants; all of them
flattering themselves with the Expectation of new Commotions. He first
worshipp&rsquo;d the King in a Temple, where there were monstrous
Idols, notwithstanding that the People are <i>Mahometans</i>. He had
afterwards private Conferences with him at Court, and in a few Days
brought him over to his Party, with his Wealth, as if he had been a
poor Man. After delivering his Master&rsquo;s Letters, he told him,
that before he went over into <i>Europe</i>, whether he was sent to
discover the Power of <i>Spain</i> in its Origin, or Source, at a Time
when it was distracted by such Revolutions, it was convenient that most
wealthy Part of <i>Asia</i> should be restor&rsquo;d to its former
Condition, a Matter of no Difficulty, if they were firmly united among
themselves. That none were so able to overthrow the Neighbouring
Monarchy, which from <i>Malaca</i> had, as it were, fetter&rsquo;d so
many Provinces, as the Kings of <i>Sumatra</i>, if they, considering of
what Moment it was to them, would stand by one another. That since he
had successfully besieg&rsquo;d that hateful City, assaulted its Walls,
and Forts, and valu&rsquo;d himself on being an Enemy to the
<i>Portugueses</i>, he ought not to let slip so favourable an
Opportunity, which offer&rsquo;d him compleat Victory. That he should
remember the several Expeditions of the Viceroys against
<i>Sumatra</i>, and that they always breed up <i>Adelantados</i>, or
Lords-Lieutenants, with their Soldiers in Pay against those Kingdoms.
And that since, till then they had not been able to make him uneasy, it
was too much Forbearance to suffer a perpetual <span class=
"marginnote"><i>The King of</i> Achem <i>complies</i>.</span> Threat of
Thraldom to subsist so near him. The King of <i>Achem</i>,
listen&rsquo;d to him with Satisfaction, as one, who, with all his
Nation, hates the Haughtiness of the <i>Portuguese</i> Behaviour; yet
he neither promis&rsquo;d, nor perform&rsquo;d any more than
obstructing the Trade of <i>Malaca</i>, till he had reduc&rsquo;d it to
Want. Nor did he keep the Secret, for they had soon an Account at
<i>Malaca</i> and <i>Goa</i> of these Contrivances. He farther
promis&rsquo;d; That whensoever the King of <i>Ternate</i> should make
a greater Invasion, or go about to extend, or enlarge himself, as far
as he pretended he had a right, he would continue to give the
Diversion, as far as stood with his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95"
href="#pb95" name="pb95">95</a>]</span>Conveniency, and that he should
have the Liberty of his Ports, and all Supplies for his Ships in his
Kingdom. <i>Nayque</i> return&rsquo;d Thanks, and extended his
Negociation, endeavouring to bring in the other Tyrants of
<i>Sumatra</i>, as for the Publick Good. Then sailing away through the
Streight of <i>Sunda</i>, so call&rsquo;d from the Name of a City in
the furthest Part of the Province, beyond the Line; he proceeded to the
greater <i>Java</i>, no less Fertile than the other in the same
Medicinal, and Odoriferous Growth, at the Time when <i>Thomas
Candish</i>, an <i>English</i> Commander was arriv&rsquo;d there,
coming from the North-Sea, by the Way of <i>New Spain</i>.</p>
<p><i>Nayque</i> went up the Country to visit, and found him in a
populous City, where he was loading Pepper, which is excellent in
<i>Java</i>, with that King&rsquo;s Leave, he being a Friend to the
<i>English</i>, who had already settled a Factory. <span class=
"marginnote">Candish <i>in</i> Java <i>presented by</i> Nayque.</span>
He found him on the Banks of a River of such a Nature, that it
presently converts any Wood whatsoever cast into it into Stone, as
solid and hard as our Pebbles. He bore the <i>Englishman</i> Company to
the Port of <i>Sunda Calapa</i>, viewed his Ship, and made as much of
him as he could. Among other Things he presented him a Pavillion,
artificially wove all with sweet scented Cloves, and not black, which
was not only fit to keep out the excessive Cold of <i>England</i>, but
even to dry up over moist Bodies that slept under it. There is daily
Experience of its atractive Virtue at <i>Ternate</i>, by placing great
Vessels full of Water in the middle of the Rooms where the Cloves
<span class="marginnote"><i>Clove atracts Water, as does</i> China
<i>Silk</i>.</span> are kept, and in the Morning they find the Heaps of
Cloves damp, and the Vessels empty and dry. The same Essential Heat is
in the Skeins of <i>China</i> Silk, which therefore those who deal in
it keep at a small Distance from the Water, yet they suck it, without
touching, and by this Fraud they weigh the heavier. Captain <i>John
Lopez de Ribera</i> carry&rsquo;d such a Pavillion of Cloves, as is
above mention&rsquo;d, and presented it to the Earl of <i>Coruna</i>,
who was then Viceroy. <i>Nayque</i>, like a Flash of Lightning which
burns all that stands in its way, endeavour&rsquo;d to stir up those
who before were kept peaceable by the Valour of <i>Fernan Tellez</i>,
and to encourage the Turbulent, but without staying to see the effect
of his Negociation, he made directly towards the Cape of
<i>Good-Hope</i>, yet it is more likely, and even positive, that he
went first to <i>Malaca</i>, and thence in the <i>India</i> Ships to
<i>Spain</i>.</p>
<p>Whilst <i>Nayque</i> was at Sea, the Marques <i>de Santa Cruz</i>
had in the Ocean fought the Fleet Commanded by <i>Philip Strozzi</i>,
in which was <i>Antony</i> the Bastard, Pretender to the Crown of
<i>Portugal</i>, and destroy&rsquo;d it, <span class=
"marginnote">Antony <i>the Bastard Defeated</i>.</span> Chastizing the
<i>French</i>, who with real, or counterfeit Commissions from their
King, had oppos&rsquo;d King <i>Philip</i>&rsquo;s just Possession. He
arrived victorious at the Island of <i>S. Michael</i>, cut off the
Heads of the <i>French</i> Gentlemen, and condemn&rsquo;d the Rest to
the Galleys. <i>Strozzi</i> dy&rsquo;d of his Wounds, and <i>Don
Antonio</i> escap&rsquo;d in a Boat, and return&rsquo;d to
<i>Zealand</i>, to solicite fresh Succours in <i>England</i> and
<i>France</i>. In the mean while, the King of <i>Achem</i>
perform&rsquo;d his Promise. His Kingdom lies next the first Promontory
of the <span class="marginnote"><i>Kingdom of</i> Achem.</span> Island,
in four Degrees and a half of North Latitude, and consequently his
Ships easily made themselves Masters of all the Streight between
<i>Sumatra</i> and <i>Achem</i>, which they so entirely
possess&rsquo;d, that they suffer&rsquo;d none of the Ships to pass to
<i>Malaca</i>, which brought Merchandize and Provisions from
<i>China</i>, <i>Japan</i>, <i>Camboxa</i>, nor even from the
<i>Moluccos</i>, obliging them to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96"
href="#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span>Coast about several Islands, to
the great Loss of the Merchants. But the <i>Portuguese</i> Dealers in
the City of <i>Pedir</i>, eight Leagues from <i>Achem</i>,
sustain&rsquo;d much greater Dammage. Most of them fled to
<i>Malaca</i>, and tho&rsquo; <i>Fernan Tellez</i> was then upon his
Departure, he gave the necessary Orders at <i>Goa</i> for their Relief.
He sunk some of the Enemies Ships, and took one loaded with Daggers,
they call <i>Crizes</i>, made at <i>Menancabo</i>, and a numerous
Artillery, a Thing well known, and cast in <i>Sumatra</i>, many Years
before the <i>Europeans</i> brought them into those Parts. This appears
by the Victory the <i>Portugueses</i> obtain&rsquo;d over that Nation,
during the Blockade of <i>Malaca</i>.</p>
<p>The King of <i>Achem</i> sending a Daughter to be Married to the
King of <i>Zor</i>, not far from <i>Malaca</i>, in the Country of
<i>Siam</i>, among other rich Gifts, <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Monstrous Piece of Cannon.</i></span> by way of
Portion, presented him a Brass Cannon of such a bigness, that the like
had never been seen in <i>Europe</i>. This prodigious Gun, and the
Princess that was to be Queen of <i>Zor</i>, fell into the Hands of the
<i>Portugueses</i>. The taking of this Prize, and some others,
clear&rsquo;d the Sea of that Fleet; and that extraordinary piece of
Cannon, which serv&rsquo;d to Ballast a Ship, was brought as a Present
to the King of <i>Spain</i>, for its Monstrous Size, but a Storm
oblig&rsquo;d them to leave it in the Island <i>Tercera</i>, where it
is now seen and admir&rsquo;d. The City <i>Zor</i> was also Taken by
the <i>Portugueses</i>, and in it they found 1500 pieces of Cannon,
Artificially Cast, with curious Figures and Flowers of
Rais&rsquo;d-Work on them. The <i>Molucco</i> Embassador <span class=
"marginnote">Molucco <i>Embassador at</i> Lisbon.</span> being come to
<i>Lisbon</i>, obtain&rsquo;d Audience of the King; who, tho&rsquo; he
was fully inform&rsquo;d of the Embassadors Falshood, and the Practices
of his Nation, yet gave him a favourable Hearing, after he had
shew&rsquo;d his Credentials to the Ministers of State. He in a long
Speech recounted, from its Original, the constant Fidelity or the
<i>Molucco</i> Kings, and how particularly Remarkable it had been in
<i>Sultan Aerio</i>, and that the wicked Commander <span class=
"marginnote"><i>His Speech.</i></span> in Chief in putting him to
Death, had equally wrong&rsquo;d the Crown of <i>Portugal</i>. That
since the Murderer was not punish&rsquo;d, to satisfy the dead
Man&rsquo;s Children and Kingdoms, it might well be concluded, that so
Cruel and Undeserv&rsquo;d an Execution had been by the Direction of
some higher Power than the Governor <i>Mesquita</i>, and that even in
case the Crime had been Notorious it had been more Prudence to charge
it upon some private Person. That King <i>Cachil Babu</i> intreated his
Majesty to punish the Offender in such manner as might give
Satisfaction, and be an Example and Security to all the <i>Asiatick</i>
Kings, that own the Dominion of <i>Spain</i>. In Return for that
Favour, and Justice, he promised to Restore the Fort of <i>Ternate</i>,
and his other Kingdoms, which were Alienated, and that they would
return to their former Subjection, as they had promis&rsquo;d to the
Governor <i>Pereyra de la Cerda</i>; so remarkably correct their
Behaviour, that there should be visible Effects of a Royal, and Humble
Gratitude, both in respect to his Majesties service, and the security
of the Garrisons, and to the Advantage of the neighbouring Provinces,
belonging to other Kings, who were his Subjects, about <i>Malaca</i>,
the <i>Philippine</i> Islands, and Parts Adjacent. He also ingaged to
Restore the Churches, and Christian Religion, and much more than had
been agreed upon with <i>Pereyra</i>. The King having heard his
Request, as if he were ignorant that the <i>Ternates</i> did not
deserve the satisfaction they requir&rsquo;d, since they had taken it
themselves so fully, that it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href=
"#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span>exceeded even the bounds and examples
of Revenge, he Answer&rsquo;d, That <span class="marginnote"><i>The
King&rsquo;s Answer.</i></span> all the Accessaries to that Fact should
be found out, it being prov&rsquo;d that the Principal was already
Dead, and none of them should escape Unpunish&rsquo;d, as would have
been done by King <i>Sebastian</i>, had he Liv&rsquo;d. That <i>Cachil
Babu</i> must prepare to Restore all Things into the same Posture they
were in before, if he intended to partake of the general Amnesty, which
blotted out all past Offences throughout the Dominions of that Crown.
<i>Nayque</i> had some private Audiences, and some Ministers of State
had Conferences with him, with a Design to find out how the People of
<i>India</i> were dispos&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>At this same Time <i>Don Gonzalo Ronquillo</i>, pursuant to the
Orders he <span class="marginnote"><i>Ensign</i> Duenas <i>from</i>
Philippines <i>to the</i> Moluccos.</span>had receiv&rsquo;d from
<i>Spain</i>, sent the Ensign, <i>Francis de Duenas</i>, from the
<i>Philippine</i> Islands, where he was Governor, to the
<i>Moluccos</i>, to pry into the Inclinations of the Kings, and People,
Governors, and other <i>Portugueses</i> at <i>Ternate</i>,
<i>Tydore</i>, and <i>Bachian</i>, as to submitting to the King of
<i>Spain</i>. He set out in the Habit of a <i>Chinese</i>, and was much
assisted by his Knowledge of those Countries, and their Languages, and
much more by his bold Spirit, sufficiently try&rsquo;d in those Wars.
He artfully Learnt what Hopes there might be of the Recovery of
<i>Ternate</i>, and how firm the People of <i>Tydore</i> stood. He
first inquired what Leagues were carrying on in the <i>Archipelago</i>,
what Intelligence they had with, and expected from the Northern Fleets,
with whom they had now familiar Correspondence. He Travell&rsquo;d
about the Islands, like a <i>Sangley</i>, or <i>Chinese</i>, in the
<i>Janguas</i>, or Trading <span class="marginnote"><i>The Intelligence
he got.</i></span> Vessels of the <i>Malay</i>, and <i>Philippine</i>
Merchants, and had the Opportunity of viewing them all, so far as to
take the Dimensions of strong Places, compute what Stores and
Ammunition the Barbarians had, and discover the Humours and
Inclinations of the <i>Portugueses</i> who Traded, or Govern&rsquo;d
there; and returning to the <i>Philippine</i> Islands, his Account, and
Relation, first Encourag&rsquo;d and gave Hopes that more Advantagious
Enterprizes might be undertaken in those Parts, than about
<i>Malaca</i>, tho&rsquo; it were but only Supporting the
<i>Portugueses</i> and <i>Tydores</i>, then hard press&rsquo;d by the
King of <i>Ternate</i>. King <i>Philip</i> receiv&rsquo;d this
Intelligence at <i>Lisbon</i>, whence the <i>Molucco</i> Embassador was
then gone, ill satisfy&rsquo;d with the Answer he had; but <i>Sultan
Babu</i>, on whom the Word of so great a Monarch, and the Authority of
his Promise might perhaps have had great Effect, dy&rsquo;d long before
the said Embassador could come to his Presence. <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Sultan</i> Babu <i>Dies</i>.</span> The small Remains
of Christianity still left in his Kingdom, took a little Heart, and had
our Arms but appear&rsquo;d upon the Revolution caus&rsquo;d by his
Death, the only Noise of them might have gain&rsquo;d the Victory. It
is Reported that furious King <i>Babu</i> dy&rsquo;d by the excess of
his Love, or rather of his inordinate Lust, in the Arms of one of his
Mistresses. Some say she kill&rsquo;d him with Charms, or Poison, which
is the Tyrant-Slayer among those Nations, impatient of one Mans long
Rule. He was Succeeded by his Brother, who was Illegitimate, as we are
told by <i>Cachil Tulo</i>, in the Letter, which, as we shall see
hereafter, he writ to the Governor of the <i>Philippine</i> Islands.
The new King took the Name of <i>Cachil Sultan Nait Dini Baraca</i>
<span class="marginnote"><i>Sultan</i> Nait <i>succeds</i>.</span>
<i>Xa</i>, before whom <i>Cachil Madraca</i> ought to have been
preferr&rsquo;d, as being Son to the principal Queen. As soon as
Enthron&rsquo;d he offer&rsquo;d Peace to his Neighbours; on this
Security, and that of a clear Conscience, <i>Cachil Gava</i>, King of
<i>Tydore</i>, paid him a visit. He was received with publick
Rejoycings <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=
"pb98">98</a>]</span>in one of the greatest Squares of <i>Ternate</i>,
and attended to a mighty lofty Arbour, provided to offer Sacrifize in,
a (Chappel suitable to the Priesthood) and there to decide
Controversies, and give Audience to his Subjects. When the first
Complements were over, and the King of <i>Tydore</i> <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Murders the King of</i> Tydore.</span> least suspected
any thing, the <i>Ternate</i> Guards, hearing the Signal given by their
K. drew their <i>Campilanes</i>, or Cymiters, and without allowing the
Guest time to cry out, fell upon, and cut him into Pieces; tho&rsquo;
he was the Man thro&rsquo; whose Means the K. of <i>Ternate</i> had the
Crown given him, contrary to the Opinion, and Designs of his Unkles.
But whensoever great Returns are due to a Favour receiv&rsquo;d,
Ungrateful Souls convert the Obligation into Hatred, and nothing can
occur to them more odious than the Sight of the Benefactor. Next he
turn&rsquo;d his Fury against that murder&rsquo;d Princes Family, and
such of his Servants as could not make their Escape to <i>Tydore</i>,
were either Kill&rsquo;d, or remain&rsquo;d Prisoners at
<i>Ternate</i>, or absconded wheresoever Fortune, and their own
Confusion lead them. This cruel Fact, which some assign&rsquo;d to his
Father, <i>Cachil Babu</i>, Reconcil&rsquo;d the Murderer and his
Unkles. But he <span class="corr" id="xd21e11467" title=
"Source: immdeiatly">immediately</span> acquainted them, how he
expected to be Invaded on two Sides; that it was of the utmost
Consequence, that Subjects should own their Sovereign, and fortify his
Islands, especially all the upper Parts; and that since he had such
Powerful Unkles, it was Reasonable, and Convenient, the People should
be acquainted how firmly they were United to their Nephew. Then
extolling their Valour, he with the sweetness of their Commendations so
blinded and amused them, that they could not perceive the profound
Jealousie he shrouded under them. Thus he divided them, that they might
attend the Fortifications in distant Places; whilst <span class=
"marginnote">New King of Tydore.</span> he in Person carry&rsquo;d on
the War against the <i>Tydores</i>. They presently set up a Brother of
their late King in his Stead; who, tho&rsquo; he govern&rsquo;d with
Bravery, and stuck close to the <i>Portugueses</i>, yet had some strong
Places taken from him by the King of <i>Ternate</i>, which were
afterwards restor&rsquo;d, in our Kings Name, by <i>Don Pedro de
Acuna</i> to the King now reigning. This Prince lived but a short Time,
yet so long that <i>Cachil Mole</i>, who was a Child when the King his
Father was murder&rsquo;d, grew up, and in him the Revenge of the
Injury receiv&rsquo;d. He never thought, or talk&rsquo;d of any other
Thing, till he brought it to Execution.</p>
<p>In the mean while the new King of <i>Tydore</i>, assisted by the
<i>Spaniards</i> he had in his Forts, provided to oppose, and attack
his Enemy. They all expected Succours from <i>India</i>, where it was
certain they must think it necessary to support <i>Tydore</i>, in order
to recover <i>Ternate</i>. Their Behaviour was so brave, as to defend
themselves, tho&rsquo; ill furnish&rsquo;d with Arms and Provisions
against those who attack&rsquo;d them with Plenty of all Things.
<i>Hector Brito</i> was come with a Galleon from <i>India</i> to their
Assistance, and <span class="marginnote"><i>He is taken by him of</i>
Ternate.</span> it being known at <i>Tydore</i> that a Storm had
oblig&rsquo;d him to stay on the farther Coast of <i>Borneo</i>, the
King fitted out four <i>Carcoas</i>, and went to meet him, but was
forced back to his Island by contrary Winds. He of <i>Ternate</i>
watch&rsquo;d to improve all Opportunities against his Enemy, and
therefore would not let this Slip, nor trust to any other; but
Man&rsquo;d out nine <i>Carcoas</i>, and going in Person fell upon him.
The <i>Tydores</i> wanted not Courage to defend themselves, and the
Fight began with that Fury, which always arms those two Nations against
one another; but tho&rsquo; the <i>Tydore</i> fought <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99</a>]</span>desperately, he was taken, and his Men either
kill&rsquo;d, or dangerously wounded. This Misfortune griev&rsquo;d the
<i>Portugueses</i> no less than the <i>Indians</i>, because they all
lov&rsquo;d him. For this reason they gather&rsquo;d the Remains of
that Disaster, and all the other Forces they could make, offering their
Service to <i>Cachil Aleazen</i>, Brother to the Captive King, a very
hopeful Youth. <span class="marginnote"><i>Fidelity of the</i>
Tydores.</span> He thank&rsquo;d them, and was so dexterous in gaining
the Affections, and confirming the Fidelity of the Subjects, that
through his Care, no Man was wanting to his Duty. This Industry was of
good Use, for the Conqueror did not return immediately to
<i>Ternate</i>; but went about to his Enemies Islands, perswading the
People in each of them to take an Oath of Allegiance to him, showing
them their Captive King, whose Life was at his disposal; but the
<i>Tydore</i> Towns, being furnish&rsquo;d with all Necessaries, and
believing they might with Safety practice that Hatred and Rage Nature
has fill&rsquo;d them with, would not give Ear to his Proposals, though
they were mix&rsquo;d with Intreaties, and Threats, and on the contrary
dismiss&rsquo;d him with their usual Fierceness. He perceiving that the
Ostentation of his Victory, and the Sight of the Captive King availed
him but little, Sail&rsquo;d away for <i>Ternate</i>. At his Arrival,
he was received with Trumpets, Kettle-Drums, and Basons they beat on,
and with Songs they make for such like Occasions. The Heads and Limbs
of the <i>Tydores</i> slain in Battel, were fix&rsquo;d <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Cruelties of</i> Ternates.</span> upon the Spears they
have advanc&rsquo;d in the <i>Carcoas</i> on the Poops and Prows, and
other high Places of them, and particularly the Kings. This is their
way of erecting Trophies. Of the Skulls they make Cups to drink out of;
like the <i>Scithians</i>, who, according to <i>Herodotus</i>, practice
the same; or like the <i>Germans</i>, as <i>Tacitus</i> tells us, of
the Heads of the <i>Uri</i> they slew, and that was a Token of
Nobility. He would not trust the keeping of the King in any of his
Forts; but turn&rsquo;d a strong House into a Goal, and appointed him a
Guard of <i>Gilolo</i> Islanders, well arm&rsquo;d. Sometimes he
show&rsquo;d Severity, and otherwhiles Tenderness; but all Men knowing
his Disposition, expected the End of the Captive King; tho&rsquo; at
the same time they believ&rsquo;d, he would mitigate his Revenge out of
Respect to his Sister, the Princess of <i>Tydore</i>. <i>Hector
Brito</i>, Commander of a <i>Galeon</i>, <span class=
"marginnote">Hector Brito <i>at</i> Tydore<span class="corr" id=
"xd21e11612" title="Source: ,">.</span></span> came now to
<i>Tydore</i>; but his Arrival did not much mend the Posture of
Affairs, tho&rsquo; those in the Fort were Encourag&rsquo;d to hold
out, and at least, he added some Reputation to the Cause, and
inclin&rsquo;d the <i>Ternates</i> to listen to some Overtures. However
what could not be compass&rsquo;d by force of Arms nor Treaty, was
effected by the Resolution of an Amorous Soul.</p>
<p>The Princess <i>Quisayra</i>, Sister to King <i>Gapabaguna</i>, that
was the Prisoner&rsquo;s <span class="marginnote"><i>Remarkable Story
of the Captive King&rsquo;s Liberty.</i></span> Name, had so great an
Opinion of herself, as to hope that her Beauty would prevail to bring
about that good End, which was then of Consequence to all Parties, on
several Accounts. She knew she was belov&rsquo;d by the King of
<i>Bachian</i>, by him of <i>Sian</i>, a brave Youth, by him of
<i>Ternate</i> her Enemy, and by other prime <i>Sangiacks</i> of his
Kingdom, and his Kinsmen, who all publickly vy&rsquo;d in doing her
Honour. She was discreet enough dexterously to feed them all with such
Hopes, as lay no Obligation on the Party that gives them, and yet
encourage those who value them. She gave out that she would marry none
but the Man that <span class="marginnote"><i>Contrivance of</i>
Quisayra, <i>Princess of</i> Tydore.</span> should set her Brother at
Liberty, and deliver him to her alive, or dead. This Part of the
Declaration, tended to the Promoting of her Design. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span>The
Promise work&rsquo;d upon all her Admirers; tho&rsquo; it was most
certain, that her naming herself as a Reward of the Enterprize,
proceeded from the Affection she bore <i>Ruy Diaz d&rsquo; Acunha</i>,
a <i>Portuguese</i> Gentleman, and Commander in Chief of the Fort of
<i>Tydore</i>. She thought he would attempt the Rescuing of the King,
and that such Success would entitle her <span class="marginnote"><i>She
is in Love with the</i> Portuguse <i>Commander</i>.</span> to marry
him, tho&rsquo; many suspected there was already a mutual Obligation,
as well as Desire, and that they were reciprocally in Love. It was
known, that they had discours&rsquo;d together several Times in the
House of <i>Quinchana</i>, a great Lady, Aunt to <i>Quisayra</i>,
whether <i>Ruy Diaz</i> was wont to go frequently; and that with her
Interposition the Matter had been so far concerted, that the Princess
promis&rsquo;d she would embrace Christianity to marry him. This made
not his Rivals dismay, and the King of <i>Ternate</i>, upon these
profer&rsquo;d Hopes, offer&rsquo;d to give her Brother his Liberty.
However he was not regarded, because <i>Quisayra</i> was as averse to
be beholding to him, as she was desirous to be oblig&rsquo;d by <i>Ruy
Diaz</i>. This powerful Passion informs barbarous Minds. Her Disdain
caus&rsquo;d the King of <i>Tydore</i> to be more close confin&rsquo;d,
and his Body to be loaded with heavy Chains, being more narrowly
observ&rsquo;d than before.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Cachil Salama <i>a Lover of</i> Quisagra,
<i>his Bravery</i>.</span> <i>Cachil Salama</i>, a Subject and near
Kinsman of his, well known for his Valour in the Wars, was more deep in
Love with <i>Quisayra</i> than all the Rest, and listen&rsquo;d to all
the Reports of their endeavouring to comply with her Expectation. He
entirely keeping his own Council, a Thing rare in Lovers, to be secret
without Affectation, that no Notice might be taken of him, one Night
fitted out a <i>Baroto</i>, so they call a Sort of small Boat, putting
into it five <i>Tydore</i> Soldiers, he could confide in. Thus he
cross&rsquo;d over the Channel to the Leeward, and landed on
<i>Ternate</i>; where he left the Boat ready, but hid on the Shore.
Then <i>Cachil Salama</i>, conceal&rsquo;d among the Croud of trading
People in the City, went to the chief Part they call <i>Limathas</i>,
and set Fire to a House in that Ward he thought stood most convenient
for his Purpose. The Flame, which had taken hold of the Roof gathering
Strength, threatned a greater Conflagration. Having done this Mischief,
whilst the People flock&rsquo;d together, and endeavour&rsquo;d to put
a Stop to it with Water, and other means, <i>Cachil</i> return&rsquo;d
to his Boat, on the Inside the Ridge of Rocks there is about the
Island, and went away to the other Side of the Fort, where he began to
beat an Alarm, to cause the greater Confusion. This done he went ashore
again, with only his <i>Campilan</i>, or Cimiter, ordering three of his
Men to follow him at some small Distance. He found the King&rsquo;s
Prison almost abandon&rsquo;d, the Guards being gone to help at the
House that was a Fire. He went in boldly, breaking open Doors, and
Bolts, till he came to the Prisoners Chamber, <span class=
"marginnote"><i>He rescues the King of</i> Tydore.</span> who scarce
believing what he saw, ask&rsquo;d him, with much Amazement, how he
came thither, and whether the Fort of <i>Tydore</i> was lost?
<i>Cachil</i> answer&rsquo;d, he must be quick, and go along with him,
and should afterwards be satisfy&rsquo;d as to his Questions; for if he
refus&rsquo;d he would strike off his Head. Then laying hold of the end
of the Chain, and the other three <i>Tydores</i> being now come up to
them, they forc&rsquo;d their Passage out of the House, making way with
their Swords and killing such as offer&rsquo;d to oppose them. The same
Valour and good Fortune carry&rsquo;d them through the Streets, to the
Port, and leaping into their little Boat, put all their Hands to the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101</a>]</span>Oars. In those Islands it is usual for Kings to
row, without being compell&rsquo;d to it by Necessity; for as in
<i>Spain</i> the Nobility learn to ride, so the Island Princes in all
those Eastern Parts value themselves upon handling the Oars, and Sails.
They cross&rsquo;d over the Streight, and being pursu&rsquo;d too late,
by the light Vessels of <i>Ternate</i>, arriv&rsquo;d unexpected at
<i>Tydore</i>. The Fame of his arrival was soon spread abroad, and when
certainly known, the Cannon was fir&rsquo;d, the flat Drums in the
Temples were beaten, and the Bells rung, the Sound whereof uses to draw
the People of the <i>Moluccos</i> together, and in short there was a
general Rejoycing, without quitting their Arms. All Men cry&rsquo;d up
<i>Cachil Salama</i> to the Skies, calling him the Deliverer of
<i>Tydore</i>, and <i>Neza Maluco</i>, <i>Neza</i> signifies a Spear,
and <i>Maluco</i> a Kingdom, and both together the Spear, that is, the
Defence of the Kingdom.</p>
<p>Only <i>Quisayra</i> was troubled at this Event, because the general
Promise <span class="marginnote">Quisayra <i>contrives to murder</i>
Cachil Salama.</span> she had made of marrying, whosoever
perform&rsquo;d it, was only design&rsquo;d for <i>Ruy Diaz de
Acunha</i>. She was not able to conceal this Truth; especially when
<i>Cachil Salama</i> boldly press&rsquo;d the Performance of the
Promise, the King himself seconding him. She delay&rsquo;d him,
alledging some specious Pretences to gain Time. She would willingly
have made her Complaint to <i>Ruy Diaz</i> himself, either to shame, or
provoke him to Passion. She easily compass&rsquo;d to meet him at her
Aunts, where, as soon as she began to Discourse, there was nothing but
Tears, Complaints, Excuses, and Contrivances to murder <i>Salama</i>,
to conclude a Reconciliation. <i>Rocque Pinheyro</i> the
Commander&rsquo;s Nephew, and a Soldier of reputed Valour, was present
at this Discourse. <i>Quisayra</i> trusting him with her secret
Thoughts, he <span class="marginnote">Pinheyro <i>undertakes to murder
him and his own Unkle</i>.</span> boldly, and with Art, gave her to
understand that his Unkle was as slack as before; and since he had been
so in the other Affair, what could be expected from him in what he now
promis&rsquo;d. He said, if she could prevail upon her self to be
sensible of the Ingratitude of <i>Ruy Diaz</i>, and to substitute him
in his Place, he would not only murder <i>Cachil</i>, but his own Unkle
too. That out of the Respect due to her high Qualities, he had not till
then presum&rsquo;d to let her know how deeply he was in Love with her
Beauty; but that he now thought himself absolv&rsquo;d from all human
Tyes, and wholly confin&rsquo;d by that. <i>Pinheyro</i> had a full
hearing, an Advantage not far remote from being admitted; and
tho&rsquo; he was not commanded to murder his Unkle, yet he
perceiv&rsquo;d he had not left him so well in the Princesses Esteem as
he was before.</p>
<p>In the mean while, <i>Cachil Salama</i> was not idle, pressing the
Business hastily, <span class="marginnote">Salama <i>convey&rsquo;d
into</i> Quisayra&rsquo;s <i>Bed Chamber</i>.</span> and having got
some Inkling, or suspecting the Cause of the Delay, like a true Lover
who is seldom deceiv&rsquo;d in this Sort of Jealousy, he found out the
Truth. By the Contrivance of one of <i>Quisayra&rsquo;s</i> Women, he
durst presume to hide himself in her Bedchamber; and in the dead of the
Night, he suddenly appear&rsquo;d before her, his Fiercness being
overcome by a Superior Power. The Princess was surpriz&rsquo;d, but
dissembled it, and prepar&rsquo;d to defend herself in Case Violence
were offer&rsquo;d. She threatned to cry out; utter&rsquo;d Complaints
with Tears, and bewail&rsquo;d the loss of her Reputation, saying, how
could they think her Innocent, who saw him either come in, or go out.
<i>Salama</i> all the while in humble Posture, and on his Knees,
assur&rsquo;d her he had no other Design, than to put her in Mind of
the Obligation she lay under, and that since it was known he was to be
her Husband, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span>his being seen was of no Consequence. That her
Reputation suffer&rsquo;d more, by the delaying of the marriage; and
that to convince her of his Affection, he would be gone as obediently
as he had always done. He went <span class="marginnote"><i>He gains her
Affection.</i></span> out immediately, comforted with Thanks, and
Hopes; and deliver&rsquo;d her from the Fear she had conceiv&rsquo;d of
him. She was so taken with this Courteous Action, that resolving it in
her Mind, it wrought so much, as to settle her Affection on
<i>Salama</i>; so that she would have marry&rsquo;d him, tho&rsquo; he
had not oblig&rsquo;d her before.</p>
<p>At this time <i>Pinheyro</i>, who was already engaged in her Love,
either to obtain its Reward, or because his Unkle did not Favour him as
he expected, <span class="marginnote">Pinheyro <i>murders his Unkle,
and is kill&rsquo;d by</i> Salama.</span> or for both Reasons,
contriv&rsquo;d his Death. As he was going one Day to the Palace, to
acquaint <i>Quisayra</i> that the Murder was already committed,
<i>Cachil</i> happened than to come from a Fort to see his Mistress. He
seeing <i><span class="corr" id="xd21e11874" title=
"Source: Pinheyra">Pinheyro</span></i> coming out of her Apartment,
drew his <i>Campilan</i>, or Cymiter, and tho&rsquo; the Youth fought
Manfully, and like a Lover, yet <i>Cachil</i>, who had the same
Qualifications, and was Jealous over and above, at the first onset
clove his Head, so furiously, that he dropt down dead of the Wound.
Then proceeding as he had begun, he went in where <i>Quisayra</i> was,
whom <span class="marginnote"><i>He marries</i> Quisayra.</span> he
easily perswaded to be gon with him, and leaving the Palace full of
Confusion, they Imbark&rsquo;d in the <i>Baroto</i>, or small Boat that
brought him. They Marry&rsquo;d with the good liking of the King and
Kingdome, and the Loss of those two Gentlemen&rsquo;s Lives. And since
among the <i>Portuguese</i> Nation, as much Account is made of Honour
gain&rsquo;d, or lost in Love Affairs, as was formerly of Victories
obtain&rsquo;d in <i>Greece</i>, at the <i>Olympick</i> Games, the
Vindication of these Lovers shall be left to the Management of those
who are well skil&rsquo;d in that Matter, to whom we refer our
selves.</p>
<p>The <i>Portugueses</i> were much griev&rsquo;d at this Disaster, as
being Publick, and the King was so incens&rsquo;d, that one of them
having accidentally kill&rsquo;d <span class="marginnote"><i>A</i>
Portuguese <i>hang&rsquo;d</i>.</span> a Horse he had a great Value
for, he caus&rsquo;d him to be Hang&rsquo;d, without hearkning to any
thing <span class="corr" id="xd21e11918" title=
"Source: thar">that</span> could be said for him. This gain&rsquo;d
<i>Cachil Mole</i> so generally the Affections of all Men, that
tho&rsquo; <i>Cachil Cota</i> was Elder, and Son to the principal
Queen, by them call&rsquo;d <i>Putriz</i>, under colour that the latter
was a Friend to the King of <i>Ternate</i>, and about to contract
Affinity with him, the other gain&rsquo;d the greater Party, which
advanc&rsquo;d him to Succeed in the Throne of <i>Tydore</i>, as we
shall soon see.</p>
<p>The <i>Portuguese</i> Galeons arrived at <i>Malaca</i>, and in them
<i>Cachil Naique</i> returning from <i>Spain</i>, and having
stay&rsquo;d there some Months for the <i>Monsons</i>, <span class=
"marginnote">Nayque <i>returns to</i> Ternate.</span> he had a good
Voyage, and arrived safe at <i>Ternate</i>, when he had by the way
sollicited the <i>Javaneses</i>, and the People of <i>Achem</i> and
<i>Borneo</i>, not to admit of the <i>Spanish</i> Domination. He
brought no acceptable Answer from King <i>Philip</i>, and found the
King who had employ&rsquo;d him Dead, and in his Place another, so
different from the Former, that he entertain&rsquo;d no Thoughts of
restoring the Forts to the <i>Portugueses</i>, but on the contrary,
aim&rsquo;d at casting off all Obedience, and obliterating their Name.
To this effect he Confederated with the <i>English</i>, who, with other
Northern <span class="marginnote">English <i>at</i> Ternate.</span>
Nations, Lorded it in the Island. Five Leagues from it lay at Anchor an
<i>English</i> Ship, waiting for two others that came out with her.
They Anchor&rsquo;d in the Port, and went ashore, as if they had been
in <i>London</i>, being well receiv&rsquo;d by the <i>Sultan</i>, with
whose Leave they settled a Factory in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb103" href="#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span>the City, where they
left Officers, who under the name of Trade, were more absolute Masters
of it than the Natives. They dispers&rsquo;d to gather in the Clove for
the Goods they brought to Barter; and on the 21st. of <i>August</i>
dispatch&rsquo;d their Ships, loaded with that Spice, and with those
Nuts they call of <i>Molucco</i>, and excellent Preserves of them both.
In these Ships went Embassadors to Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>, and to the
Prince of <i>Orange</i>, carrying Presents suitable to those Persons,
of the most valuable Things in <i>India</i>. They were order&rsquo;d to
offer the Queen his Kingdome in Vassalage, and his Friendship to the
Prince of <i>Orange</i>. The Advantage of these Embassies afterwards
appear&rsquo;d; yet he did not on that Account give any hopes of
Restoring Christianity; for besides that the Persecution grew more
violent, he had at that time brought over into his Kingdome, a great
number of <i>Arabian</i> and <i>Persian</i> false Prophets, all of them
<i>Mahomet</i>&rsquo;s Priests and Ministers, <span class=
"marginnote">Mahometan <i>Preachers at</i> Ternate.</span> to
strengthen that Sect. Besides, being inform&rsquo;d by his Spies, That
it was given out in the <i>Philippine</i> Islands, That they would make
War on him that way, and that in <i>Spain</i> the King promis&rsquo;d
the Union of the two Crowns should produce the Conjunction of their
Power and Arms, for the punishing of disobedient Tyrants, he slighted
no Alliance, nor contemn&rsquo;d the Weakest Enemy. For this Reason, he
gave Entertainment, and allow&rsquo;d the planting of Colonies to
<i>Europeans</i>, and Leagued with <i>Idolaters</i> and
<i>Mahometans</i>, who hate <i>Spain</i>, as their common Enemy. The
<i>English</i> Ships now frequented <i>India</i>, facilitating the
Passage, and shewing an Example to the <i>French</i> and <i>Dutch</i>,
which encourag&rsquo;d them all to venture out far from their
Countries, and seek for Treasure in strange ones.</p>
<p><i>Sultan Capabaguna</i> did not long enjoy his Liberty at
<i>Tydore</i>. He was <span class="marginnote"><i>King of</i> Ternate
<i>dies</i>.</span> taken ill at an Entertainment. Some believe he had
a slow Poison given him; because he was very moderate in Eating, and
those motions of his Arms, the gnashing of his Teeth, and losing of his
Senses, which attend the Falling-Sickness, and are Simptoms of
Apoplexies, could not naturally proceed from his Temperate way of
Living; but are always caused by much Excess, which Occasions this
violent Distemper. He came to himself after that first Fit, but his
Vigour wasted, and he linger&rsquo;d on to the end of his Life.
<i>Cachil Cotta</i> should have Succeeded him, but they were suspicious
of his Correspondence with the <i>Ternates</i>; and they all so openly
favour&rsquo;d his Brother <i>Cachil Mole</i>, that there was not the
least Difficulty made about the Succession. He often remember&rsquo;d
his Fathers unfortunate Death, and in Regard that this raging Desire of
Revenge, might prove instrumental for the Recovery of <i>Ternates</i>;
as soon as his Unkle Dy&rsquo;d, which was on the 24th of <i>April</i>
1599, the <i>Portuguese</i> Commander in Chief, <i>Ruy Gonzalez de
Sequeyrao</i> repair&rsquo;d to his Palace, and by Means of the
<i>Portuguese</i> <span class="marginnote">Cachil Mole <i>King of</i>
Tydore.</span> Power and Arms, caused <i>Cachil Mole</i> to be sworn
King, as being a most faithful Friend to his Nation, and no less an
Enemy to the <i>Ternates</i>. He immediatly dispatch&rsquo;d Captain
<i>Palma</i> with this News to <i>Manila</i>, and with it an Account of
the <i>Molucco</i> Islands, of their Neighbours, and of their
Preparations; because they were then providing in the <i>Philippine</i>
Islands for this War, to extirpate this Receptacle of Sects, where all
sorts of Apostasies are admitted, and particularly the vile Doctrines
of <i>Mahomet</i>. Ever since the Year 1555, when the <i>Dutch</i>
enter&rsquo;d those Seas, they have <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb104" href="#pb104" name="pb104">104</a>]</span>not, till this Time,
ceas&rsquo;d bringing in Sectaries, and Captains of Pyrates: These Men
carry away the Wealth of <i>Asia</i>, and in Lieu of it leave
<span class="corr" id="xd21e12147" title="Source: dehind">behind</span>
them that false Doctrine, which renders the Conversion of so many Souls
Fruitless.</p>
<p>The Forgetfulness, or Contempt the Governours of <i>India</i>
show&rsquo;d for <span class="marginnote">Moluccos <i>slighted at</i>
Goa.</span> the <i>Molucco</i> Islands, seem&rsquo;d fatal; since they
refus&rsquo;d, or with-held the usual Succours, abandoning the
Commanders, and Forts, for so many Years, as if they had not been in
the World. This was not remedy&rsquo;d by the Union of the Crowns of
<i>Spain</i> and <i>Portugal</i>; on the contrary, the great Success of
the <i>Adelantado</i>, or Lord Lieutenant <i>Legaspe</i>, in the
Islands <i>Luzones</i>, which he call&rsquo;d <i>Philippines</i>, being
known in <i>Spain</i>, King <i>Philip</i> the IId. thought fit as we
shall soon see, that the <i>Molucco</i> Islands, and Parts adjacent,
whither he was Zealous to send Evangelical Preachers, should be
sensible of the Advantage of his Neighbouring Empire. This was
<span class="marginnote"><i>Relief order&rsquo;d from the</i>
Philippines, <i>and why</i>.</span> speedily order&rsquo;d, and
tho&rsquo; the Effects were not sutable, by Reason of the many
Accidents great Undertakings are liable to, yet Time has shown how
convenient it was to fix that Resolution. For the better understanding
of the Reasons on which it was grounded; since one of them proceeded
from the various Disposition, Qualities, and Interests of the Nations
throughout those Seas and Lands; it will be absolutely necessary in
this Place to make them known, before we come to Particulars.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Description of</i> China.</span> The
Country of the Sin&aelig;, whom we call <i>Chineses</i>, is the
uttermost of the Continent of <i>Asia</i>. On the East and South it is
encompass&rsquo;d by the Ocean, which the Ancients call&rsquo;d
<i>Sericus</i>. On the West, it reaches to the Borders of the farther
<i>India</i>; and on the North to those of the <i>Massagetes</i> and
<i>Scythians</i>. Their Ancient Annals, Writings and Traditions informs
us, that the <i>Chineses</i> extended their Empire much further. This
is verify&rsquo;d by the Remains of sumptuous Structures; and not only
in Ruins, wherein their former Magnificence is still apparent, but even
in Cities, which Time has preserv&rsquo;d, tho&rsquo; not inhabited,
and yet to be seen in the Provinces they have excluded their Limits.
There are many which take there Denomination, and own their Original
from <i>China</i>. For that immense Empire finding it self labouring
under its own Power, and overburden&rsquo;d with its Magnitude, like a
judicious Patient, to prevent more Harm, it breath&rsquo;d the Veins,
and brought down the Redundancy of the Body. The same we read the
<i>Carthagenians</i> did, when in the like Condition, and for the same
Reasons. It confin&rsquo;d it self to a narrower Compass,
proportionable to the Extent of humane Providence, that so their
Prince&rsquo;s Light might reach to shine over, and be communicated to
them; which cannot be, when the Circumference is too great for the
Darting of the Beams. They publish&rsquo;d indispensable Decrees
against such as go out <span class="marginnote">Chineses <i>contract
their Empire</i>.</span> of <i>China</i>, without leave from the
Magistrates. They abandon&rsquo;d vast Provinces, which being left
expos&rsquo;d to Tyranny, and Infidelity, after tedious Wars, submitted
to the most Potent. Hence the Kings of <i>India</i> took their
Original, being oblig&rsquo;d never to lay down their Arms, nor keep
any Faith, so to support themselves one against another, till a greater
Power subdues them.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">15 <i>Kingdoms in</i> China.</span> In
<i>China</i> they reckon 15 maritime Kingdoms, or Provinces of an
extraordinary Extent, with each its Metropolis, or Capital; the rest
are up the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span>Inland. The most part of it lies within
temperate Climates, and receives into its pure and open Bosome the
Sun&rsquo;s vital Rays, having a healthful, and serene pleasant air.
This favourable Disposition renders it so fruitful, <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Fertility, Air, Populousness.</i></span> that it yearly
yields two or three crops. The great Industry of the Tillers, is a
considerable Addition to its Fertility. The Number of them is infinite,
being a People that daily multiply exceedingly, because they are forbid
going into foreign Countries. Neither is any among such a numerous
Multitude of Men allow&rsquo;d to live idle<span class="corr" id=
"xd21e12264" title="Not in source">.</span> Idleness is not only
exposed <span class="marginnote"><i>Idleness punish&rsquo;d.</i></span>
to private Contempt, and the Scoffs of Neighbours, but punish&rsquo;d
by publick Custome and Law. Thus the Peasants leave not the least Spot
of Ground untill&rsquo;d. The Hills and deep Bottoms produce Vines and
Pine-Trees; the Plains, Rice, Barley, Wheat, and other common Grain.
Tho&rsquo; they do not press the Grapes for the Wine, as we do, yet
they keep them <span class="marginnote"><i>Product, Tea.</i></span> to
eat; and of the Herb call&rsquo;d <i>Chia</i>, they make a wholesome
hot Liquor. This they drink, as do the <i>Japoneses</i>, and it
preserves them from Colds, Head-Aches, Rheums in the Eyes, and makes
them live long and healthy. Some Parts of the Country want Olive-Trees,
but they are not destitute of other Plants, which yield a Liquor to
anoint them. There is a perpetual Abundance of Pasture, Fruits,
Flowers, and all Products of Gardens. <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Rivers</i>, <i>Ports</i>, &amp;c.</span> There are many
Navigable Rivers, carrying Ships of great Burden, and full of excellent
Fish; the Banks cover&rsquo;d with perpetual Greens, spacious Harbours,
and a Trade in them of all Things necessary for humane Life. The Fowl
are of various colour&rsquo;d Feathers, and pleasant and nourishing to
eat; great Numbers of large Deer; vast Lakes, Woods and Mountains, and
Mines of Gold, Silver, Iron, and other Metals; besides Pearls and
precious Stones. Its Purcelane, or Earthen Ware, is not to be imitated
in the World; and it affords rich Furs against the Cold, Silks, Wooll,
Cotton, and Flax; nor is there any End of its Sugar, Honey, Amber,
Vermilion, and Lake. Musk, whereof no mention is found among
<i>Greek</i> and <i>Latin</i> Authors, is more plentiful in
<i>China</i> than in other Parts.</p>
<p>The People are most passionately addicted to Delight, and
Lasciviousness. <span class="marginnote"><i>The People.</i></span> They
alone always sell all Things; they buy nothing that Nature or Art
affords, either for Sustenance, or Cloathing, except some Perfumes for
their Cloaths, and Pepper out of <i>India</i>; nor would there be any
Place for Foreign Trade, did not an insatiable Avarice of Gold and
Silver predominate among the <i>Chineses</i>. What they draw out of the
Bowels of the Mines, they conceal as carefully as if it were still in
them; and even that they bring from remote Provinces, they heap up, and
bury. Their publick and private Structures would make up a Narration of
extraordinary Length. We are told of 200 Cities of an extraordinary
Magnitude, <span class="marginnote"><i>Cities.</i></span> and many more
of inferior Degree, besides Towns, Castles, and Villages, containing
above 3000 Families each, built of Bricks made of the same Clay as our
Purcelane, or <i>China</i> Ware, and these encompass&rsquo;d with
continu&rsquo;d Woods, Springs and Rivers. In all these there are
Towers with stately Pinnacles, Pleasure-Houses, and Temples, tho&rsquo;
hideously painted, yet costly, with Variety of deform&rsquo;d Images,
through which the Devils give their Answers. But these are not in all
Parts, for many of them know no God, nor Religion. Life, they say, was
from Eternity <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span>common to, and alike in all living Creatures.
That at first Men drank <span class="marginnote"><i>Barbarous
Opinions.</i></span> humane Blood, and eat raw Meat. That afterwards
the Use of Reason provided for Necessity, and Pleasure; inventing the
Ways of dressing, and seasoning Meat at the Fire, in Vessels and other
Utensils. The same, they say, happen&rsquo;d in Regard to Man&rsquo;s
Nakedness. So that Man is indebted to himself alone for what he enjoys,
and therefore whosoever lay&rsquo;d on him the Burden of Religion, and
the owning of a Cause Superior to Nature, only aim&rsquo;d at the
dejecting him, and exercising a Tyranny over his Liberty. With these
impious Notions, and destructive Atheism, they oppose their Eternal
Salvation, which our Arms, and our Preachers invite them to. They only
regard Generation; but not without Distinction. Lawful Matrimony
entitles Women to be Mistresses of their Families. The Matrons
<span class="marginnote"><i>Chastity.</i></span> value themselves upon
being highly Chast. Concubines are kept in Houses apart. They do not
want for Plays, and such Representations; and they delight in seeing
their Traditions, whether true or fabulous, acted on the Stage. They
use Entertainments, and have Tables and Chairs of <i>Ebony</i>, and
other precious Materials; as also Shipping, Shows, Carts,
Horse-Litters, and the Exercise of Arms, and Riding.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Customs, and Manners.</i></span> It were
no difficult Matter to give an Account here of their private Customs
and Manners, were they to our Purpose. Something shall be said of the
Publick and Political, for the better Understanding of some Things that
happen&rsquo;d in the <i>Philippine</i> Islands, from whence the
Recovery of the <i>Moluccos</i>, in our Times, had its Beginning. They
call their great <span class="marginnote"><i>Government.</i></span> Men
<i>Loyties</i>, from among whom the King chuses his Judges and
Counsellors. There is almost an infinite Number of inferiour
Magistrates, who exercise the Regal Power and Authority, even in the
most inconsiderable Cases. In every Town there are five, that have the
greatest Power, and these are Strangers in the Place, that they may be
free from Partiality. <span class="marginnote">Tutan <i>a
Viceroy</i>.</span> The Head of them all, is call&rsquo;d <i>Tutan</i>,
being the same as a Viceroy in <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Poncasio.</i></span> <i>Europe</i>. The next in Dignity
is the <i>Poncasio</i>, who has Charge of the King&rsquo;s Taxes, and
Royal Treasure, with a great Number of Clerks, and other <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Ancasio.</i></span> Officers; and he pays all Salaries
and Pensions. Next follows the <i>Ancasio</i>, <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Aitan.</i></span> who is chief Justice, in Criminal
Cases of Consequence. The <i>Aitan</i> has the Inspection of all
Martial Affairs, he musters the Armies, builds the Ships, and his
principal Duty is to observe the Guards, that no Stranger <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Luitisio.</i></span> may pass into the Inland Country.
The <i>Luitisio</i> is next to the <i>Aitan</i> in Dignity, and is to
be expert in War, in which he is employ&rsquo;d by the <i>Aitan</i>. I
know there are other Magistrates, and their Names and Dignities, which
I must pass over in Silence. All of them except the <i>Luitisio</i>,
keep great State. There are ten chosen Persons of the Council,
tho&rsquo; not equal in Authority. Five of them sit on the Right, the
others on the Left. The King often thrusts in among the Judges and
Parties in Disguize, to pry into the Causes, and their Decisions, and
be certainly inform&rsquo;d of both. When he thinks fit, he sometimes
makes himself known; and the Moment he discovers himself, they all
stand Mute, full of Respect and Astonishment, listening to what he
shall command. Then he commends or reproves either Party, and rewards,
or punishes before he <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Mandarines.</i></span> departs the Court. His
<i>Mandarines</i>, and Prime Ministers are so highly respected, that no
Man dares look them in the Face, and they always look <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name="pb107">107</a>]</span>so
Stern, that it would be thought a great Disorder to lose the least of
their Gravity, tho&rsquo; it were but with a modest Smile. This they
observe, when they pass thro&rsquo; the Streets, in Sight of the
People. The greatest Honour among them is to wear a Cymiter with a gold
Pommel, and a yellow Hat.</p>
<p>When the President of the Council Dies, the eldest Judge succeeds
him. <span class="marginnote">Judges.</span> These go Circuits
thro&rsquo; the Provinces, and reform Abuses, and all of them wear the
King&rsquo;s Badge on their Shoulders, and Breasts, being a Golden
Dragon wove in the Cloth. When they go these Progresses, they save, or
lessen the Charge by circumscribing the State. When first elected, at
their taking Possession of their Posts, they generally go out attended
by Troops of Horse and Foot, with all Sorts of Musick, and Splendour.
Their Pomp appears in the Hanging, and other Ornaments of the Streets
and Houses. All the expence of Law Suits, Courts, and other Perquisites
is allow&rsquo;d out of the King&rsquo;s Exchequer. The
<i>Mandarines</i> are Governors, and Viceroys. In <i>China</i> there
are no Dukes, Marquesses, or Earls, nor do they own any Dignity, but
what is deriv&rsquo;d from the King&rsquo;s Authority. Though in the
Parts next to <i>Scythia</i>, or <i>Tartary</i>, some People are
<i>Mahometans</i>; yet in all <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Religion.</i></span> others they are either Idolaters,
or look upon the Notion of a God as a meer Jest. They believe the Life
and Death of Men and Beasts are alike. There is nothing they are more
attentive to, than the obstructing of any foreign Religion, and this
under the politick Pretence, that they are jealous of Innovation. But
above all they oppose the true Religion, hating that they know nothing
of; and are as much afraid of it, as if its Ministers went arm&rsquo;d
to preach it, and with the Noise of Drums, and Trumpets, and regular
Armies. They are frighted at a few bare-foot, and almost naked Men who
profess Poverty, and preach up Morality, and supernatural Virtues,
grounded on Humility and Peace. They have such an Aversion for them,
that were it proper to our Subject, or were there not printed Relations
thereof already, we would recount several Instances, to show their
unreasonable Hatred. Hence may be inferr&rsquo;d, how much more Need of
the special Grace of Heaven these Nations stand in, with those in the
Neighbourhood, which are expos&rsquo;d to the Infection and Danger of
their Obstinacy. The Reader ought also to consider, that tho sometimes,
the Avarice, and other Crimes of our Commanders, and Soldiers interfere
with the Preaching of the Gospel, yet their Offences do not lessen the
Iustice of the Cause. He is also to reflect, that, allowing his
Majesty, for weighty Reasons of State should, as we have said was
propos&rsquo;d, resolve to abandon those Parts of <i>Asia</i>, as the
<i>Chineses</i> did, and circumscribe the Compass of his Monarchy; yet
the Cause of Religion would not permit it. Our Kings are its Ministers,
and Sons of the Catholick Church, and any War made for the Propagation
of the Gospel, is of the greatest Consequence, and highly gainful,
tho&rsquo; it be to acquire, or recover desert Provinces. Besides that
the <i>Philippine</i> Islands have shown us how tractable their Natives
are, and how much they improve with the Example, and Society of the
<i>Spaniards</i>, and how affectionately they have imbrac&rsquo;d the
Faith, and assist the Religious Men, who dilate, and carry it over into
<i>China</i>, <i>Japan</i>, <i>Camboxa</i>, <i>Mindanao</i>, the
<i>Moluccos</i>, and other Islands, where still Idolatry continues, or
the Friendship with the Devils left them by their antient Masters, when
they excluded <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span>them their Dominions, or else the
<i>Mahometan</i> Fictions, which they have since imbrac&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>This is the Principal End of keeping those Provinces; and the
Revenues and Wealth which is consum&rsquo;d upon them, and several
others, are laid out upon the Forces, and Preparations <i>Spain</i>
makes for the Preaching and Security of the Ministers of the Church.
Besides, that as Times have alter&rsquo;d, <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Rumours of Chinese Invasions.</i></span> so they have
often in <i>China</i> chang&rsquo;d their Opinion, and show&rsquo;d
they repented their having diminish&rsquo;d their Empire. No Year
passes over with out Threats of <i>Chinese</i> Armies; of their Listing
Men; of building Ships; of their solemn consecrating, or dedicating
them to their carv&rsquo;d Gods, or to the Sun, Moon, and Stars, which
are ador&rsquo;d in some Parts, begging Success in their vain Prayers
against the <i>Spaniards</i>, who are possess&rsquo;d of those
Countries they abandon&rsquo;d, thro&rsquo; their own Indiscretion.
This short Account of the <i>Chineses</i>, or <i>Sangleys</i>, is here
inserted, for the better understanding of those Actions we shall soon
treat of. They not only oppose the Truth; but tho&rsquo; they are
wholly addicted to their Interest, and Slaves to Gain, and tho&rsquo;
it be so absolutely requisite for the attaining of those Ends through
their Industry and Trade, to maintain Amity with their Neighbours, yet
there is nothing less to be reliy&rsquo;d on than their Faith, or to
give it a more proper Name, their Dissimulation. Happy those People, if
when <i>China</i> withdrew its Dominion, it had also with drawn the
Errors of its Worship.</p>

<p class="first">The Islands <i>Luzones</i>, or <i>Manilas</i>, which
are both of them antient Names, having been discover&rsquo;d by
<i>Magellan</i>; after his Death, and various Accidents befallen his
Companions, <i>Sebastian</i> <span class="marginnote">Sebastian Cano
<i>the first that sail&rsquo;d round the World</i>.</span> <i>Cano</i>
return&rsquo;d to <i>Spain</i> in that renowned Ship, call&rsquo;d the
<i>Victory</i>, as it were to express her Voyage, which is not so
likely as true. <i>Sebastian Cano</i>, was born in the Town of
<i>Guetaria</i>, on the <i>Pyrenean</i> Mountains, as we are told by
<i>Mass&aelig;us</i>, in his <i>Latin</i> History, where he extols
<i>Cano</i>&rsquo;s mighty Resolution, and skill in the Art of
Navigation. He tell us with what Respect and Admiration all Men
look&rsquo;d on him, as the first that went round this Globe, which is
the Habitation of Mortals. And in Truth what value shall we
henceforward put upon the Fabulous <i>Argonauts</i>, <i>Tiphys</i>,
<i>Jason</i>, and all other Sailers, so much celebrated by the
<i>Greek</i> Eloquence, or Vanity, if compar&rsquo;d with our
<i>Cano</i>? He was the first Witness of the Communication of the two
Seas, to whom Nature disclos&rsquo;d what she had till then
reserv&rsquo;d for his Discovery, suffering herself to be entirely
lay&rsquo;d open, as a Beginning of such Bold Enterprizes of that Law
which serves, and renders us Immortal.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Islands</i> Lusones <i>call&rsquo;d</i>
Philippines.</span> <i>Magellan</i> being dead, the islands
<i>Lusones</i>, which ought to have inherited his Name for being his
Place of Burial, as the Streight did for his discovering and passing
it, in the year 1565, chang&rsquo;d theirs for that of
<i>Philippines</i>, tho&rsquo; those of that Eastern <i>Archipelago</i>
bear the same. The <i>Adelantado</i>, or Lord Lieutenant <i>Michael de
Legaspe</i>, sent from New-Spain, by the Viceroy <i>Don Lewis de
Velasco</i>, with a <i>Spanish</i> Fleet arriv&rsquo;d at these
Islands. He first conquer&rsquo;d that of <i>Zebu</i>, and its
Neighbours, where he spent six <span class="marginnote">Legaspe <i>the
first Conqueror</i><span class="corr" id="xd21e12641" title=
"Not in source">.</span></span> Years. These Islands, as there are
several Names given to divers of those Parts, are call&rsquo;d
<i>Pintados</i>, because then the <i>Indians</i> went naked, and their
Bodies wrought and painted of several Colours. He left a Garrison
there, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name=
"pb110">110</a>]</span><span class="marginnote">Luzon <i>Island
subdu&rsquo;d</i>.</span> and went over to possess himself of
<i>Luzon</i>, 150 Leagues from <i>Zebu</i>. He fought the Barbarians,
who after the first Surprize, caus&rsquo;d by our Arms, Ships, and
Countenances, differing from theirs, was over, were encourag&rsquo;d by
that very Novelty. <i>Legaspe</i> ran into a Bay, four Leagues over at
the Mouth, where is an Island now call&rsquo;d <i>Marivelez</i>. The
Bay runs thirty Leagues up to the City <i>Manila</i>, and is eight
Leagues over, lying North-West, and South-East. The Inhabitants of this
City oppos&rsquo;d him with more Bravery than the <i>Pintados</i>;
because they had Cannon, and a Fort, but as soon as they saw that taken
by the <i>Spaniards</i>, they submitted. This was done so expeditiously
that the Country had not time to come in; and thus he enter&rsquo;d
<i>Manila</i>, a Place strong by Nature. At a Point of it, which is
shut in by the Waters of the Bay, a considerable River empties it self,
which rises in the Great Lake call&rsquo;d <i>Vay</i>, five Leagues
Distant. This Point which at first is narrow and sharp, presently
widens, because the Sea-coast runs away to the South South-East, and
the River West, leaving a most <span class="marginnote">Manila
<i>City</i>.</span> spacious Spot for the City, which is all
encompass&rsquo;d with Water, except that part which lyes to the
South-West. <i>Legaspe</i> then built it of Wood, whereof there is
great plenty in those parts. The Roofs he cover&rsquo;d, or
Thatch&rsquo;d with the Leaves of <i>Nipa</i>, which is like our Sedge,
or Sword-Grass, and a sufficient Fence against the Rains; but a
Combustible Matter, and the occasion of Great Conflagrations, which
have often hapned.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Luzon <i>Island describ&rsquo;d</i>.</span>
<i>Luzon</i> is more Populous than any of the other Islands, which in
Honour of King <i>Philip</i> the Second, were call&rsquo;d
<i>Philippines</i>, and which some affirm are in Number 11000. The
Compass of <i>Luzon</i> is 350 Leagues. It runs without the Bay 100
Leagues to the Northward, as far as <i>New Segovia</i>; and from where
this Province commences, which is at Cape <i>Bojador</i>, and 70
Leagues from it, turns to the Eastward, to the Promontory <i>del
Enganno</i>; from thence along the Coast to the South, 80 Leagues; then
turning again to that they call <i>Embocadero</i>, or the Mouth, being
the Streight against the Island <i>Tandaya</i>, 40 Leagues, and this is
80 from the Bay. So that it bears the shape of a Square, and in it
several Bays, and few good Harbours. It lyes in 160 Degrees Longitude,
reckoned from the <i>Canaries</i>, the Southermost Part in 14 Degrees
of North Latitude, and the Northermost in 19. On that Side of it lyes
<i>China</i>, separated from it by the Sea 60 Leagues over; and the
Islands of <i>Japan</i>, 250 Leagues distant. On the East is the Vast
Ocean; on the South is the greatest of all the <i>Archipelagos</i>,
divided into five, and those again rent into so many Islands, Kingdoms,
and Provinces, as if Nature had resolv&rsquo;d that Man should never
determine their Number. The most known are the two <i>Javas</i>, our
<i>Moluccos</i>, <i>Borneo</i>, and <i>New Guinea</i>. On the West of
<i>Luzon</i>, at 300 Leagues, and greater Distances, lye <i>Malaca</i>,
<i>Siam</i>, <i>Patan</i>, <i>Camboxa</i>, <i>Cochin-china</i>, and
several other Provinces on the Continent of <i>Asia</i>. The
<i>Chineses</i> forsook their Habitations in our <i>Philippine</i>
Islands, but not the Trade. Neither did the Worship they had
introduc&rsquo;d cease, nor their Fertility. <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Product, and Trade.</i></span> They produce plenty of
Corn, and other necessary Grain; Deer, Cows, Buffaloes, Goats, and Wild
Boars; Fruit, and Sweets; and if any be wanting the <i>Chincheo
Chineses</i> bring it, as they do Porcelane, and Silks. The Wine they
use, and always drank, is drawn from the Palm, or rather <i>Coco</i>
Trees, cutting off the Clusters of the Fruit they produce, when Green,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=
"pb111">111</a>]</span>and taking off the Nipples of them, they gather
the Water that runs from them, and Boil it in Jars, till it becomes so
strong, that it makes Men drunk, in the same manner as the strongest
<i>Spanish</i> Wine. Of its Natural Growth, the Island has Oranges,
Lemmons, and most delicious Citrons; of <i>Spanish</i> Fruit, Figs, and
Pears. There are Numerous Breeds of Sparrow-Hawks, <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Birds.</i></span> Birds like small Herons, and Eagles,
besides sundry Sorts of Parrots, and other large and small Fowl. In the
Rivers and Lakes there are many Monstrous Crocodils, or Alligators.
These easily kill the <i>Indians</i>, <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Alligators</i><span class="corr" id="xd21e12817" title=
"Not in source">.</span></span> and especially Boys, who happen
unadvisedly to come where they are, and the Cattle that goes into the
Water to drink. It often happens, they lay hold of their Snouts, or
Noses, and draw them under Water, where they are drown&rsquo;d, without
being able to defend themselves; then they drag the Carcass to the
Shore, and devour it. An Alligator being kill&rsquo;d a whole Buffaloes
Head has been found some times in the Belly, and yet in that Country
they are as big as the largest Ox in <i>Spain</i>. The Alligators lay
Eggs as the Tortoises do, about the bigness of Goose-Eggs, and so hard
that they will scarce break, tho&rsquo; struck against a Stone with
main Force. They are Hatch&rsquo;d by burying in the Sand, near the
edge of the Water; the moisture whereof, with the Heat of the Sun forms
the young Ones. There are some <i>Indians</i> so brave, that as fierce
as these Creatures <span class="marginnote"><i>How the</i> Indians
<i>fight the Alligators</i>.</span> are, they kill them with their
Hands. They arm the left up to the Arm with a Glove of Buffalo&rsquo;s
Hide. They hold in it a Stick, or small Stake, somewhat above a Foot
long, and as thick as a Man&rsquo;s Wrist, and sharpned at both Ends,
with which they go into the Water up to the Waste: The Crocodile makes
up to the <i>Indian</i>, gaping to swallow him, and he holding out his
Arm that is arm&rsquo;d, and the Hand with the Stake in it, for the
Monster to bite at, claps it across his Mouth, so that he cannot shut
it, or make use of his Teeth to hurt him. The Alligator feeling the
hurt of the sharp pointed Stick, is so dismayed that he neither makes
resistance, nor offends, nor dares so much as move, because the least
strugling gauls him. Then the <i>Indian</i> holding fast the Stake,
with a Ponyard he has in his other Hand, Wounds the Creature so often
about the Gills, till it bleeds to Death. Then he drags it ashore with
Ropes and Noozes, many <i>Indians</i> joyning to draw, and there is
need of many, considering the Bulk of those Crocodiles. They are
shap&rsquo;d like Lizards, but arm&rsquo;d with such strong Shells,
that a Musket-shot makes little Impression on them, and they are scarce
to be hurt, but only about the Gills, and under their short Legs, where
Nature has plac&rsquo;d a sort of sweet Odour, which the <i>Indians</i>
make their Advantage of. These Islands, besides the Cattel, produce all
that is found in <i>Africk</i>, as Tygers, Lions, Bears, Foxes,
Monkeys, <span class="marginnote"><i>Beasts.</i></span> Apes,
Squirrels, and some of them Abundance of Civet-Cats, which are much
Hunted, in order to be sent into several Countries, with other
Commodities of <i>China</i>; Callicoes, Silks, Porcelane, Iron, Copper,
Steel, <span class="marginnote"><i>Commodities.</i></span> Quicksilver,
and many more Yearly Transported from those Countries. The Religion and
Government is now the same as in <i>Spain</i>; but in those which are
not yet subdu&rsquo;d, they follow an Extravagant Idolatry; believing
the Soul Immortal, but wandering from one Body to another, according to
that ridiculous Transmigration invented or published by
<i>Pythagoras</i>. They are much addicted to Trade, and forwarded in it
by the Commerce <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112"
name="pb112">112</a>]</span>with China. The <i>Philippine</i> People
are braver than their Neighbours; the <i>Spaniards</i> and their Breed
do not degenerate from their Original.</p>
<p>An Army was now forming of all these Sorts of People, by Order of
the King, to attempt recovering the Forts of the <i>Moluccos</i>.
<i>Don Ronquillo de Pennalosa</i> was then Governour there; and
tho&rsquo; he had receiv&rsquo;d some Intelligence <span class=
"marginnote">Ronquillo&rsquo;s <i>Preparations for the</i>
Moluccos.</span> brought him thence by Spies and Traders, yet not
satisfy&rsquo;d with it, he sent thither another Soldier. He disguised
himself, and being like the Natives in Countenance, and speaking their
Language to Perfection, got to <i>Tydore</i>. He found our People very
earnest to forward that Enterprize, and that King ready to support it
with all his Power. Thence he pass&rsquo;d over to <i>Ternate</i>,
among Merchants, where he view&rsquo;d the Forts, the Shoals of the
Harbours; observ&rsquo;d their Correspondence with the <i>English</i>,
and took notice how they Landed, and Traded in all Safety, or rather
with Authority. Nor was he unacquainted with the Numbers of
conceal&rsquo;d Christians, who would take up Arms when a seasonable
Opportunity was offer&rsquo;d, or any other Particular, which
belong&rsquo;d to a Judicious Spy to enquire into. Hereupon
<i>Ronquillo</i> gather&rsquo;d about 300 <i>Spaniards</i>, and above
1500 Natives <span class="marginnote"><i>The Forces sent under</i>
Sarmiento.</span> of the <i>Philippines</i>, with Ammunition,
Provisions, and Seamen, and at the proper Season sent them for the
<i>Moluccos</i> in three Great Ships, and a considerable Number of
Small Ones. <i>Peter Sarmiento</i>, a brave and experienc&rsquo;d
Officer, still living in those Islands, when this was writ, went as
General. He had Courage, and Force to destroy any of the Enemies that
then frequented those Seas. His Majesty had some time before
bestow&rsquo;d the Government of <i>Ternate</i>, if it were
Conquer&rsquo;d, on <i>Paul de Lima</i>; and <span class=
"marginnote">Paul de Lima <i>rich in the</i> Moluccos.</span>
allow&rsquo;d his Brother <i>Francis de Lima</i> to make two Voyages to
the <i>Moluccos</i>, in Consideration of their Services, and those of
<i>Henry</i> their Father. <i>Paul</i> was Marry&rsquo;d to a
Christian, and devout Lady, tho&rsquo; a Kinswoman to the King of
<i>Ternate</i>, who was not so. For this Reason, and because he had
been possess&rsquo;d in <i>Ternate</i>, of the ancient Inheritance of
the Villages of <i>Guita</i>, <i>Mofaquia</i>, <i>Mofaguita</i>,
<i>Pavate</i>, <i>Pelveri</i>, <i>Sansuma</i>, <i>Takane</i>,
<i>Mayloa</i>, and <i>Soma</i>; and in the Island of <i>Machian</i> of
<i>Sabele</i>, <i>Talapao</i>, <i>Talatoa</i>, <i>Mofabonana</i>,
<i>Tabaloga</i>, <i>Tagono</i>, <i>Bobaba</i>, and <i>Molapa</i>; and
in Regard the King of <i>Ternate</i>, had expell&rsquo;d him most of
them, as also of <i>Bitua</i> in <i>Tydore</i>, and several other
Places, he went over to <i>Manila</i>, as a Banish&rsquo;d Man, where
he confer&rsquo;d with the Governour, about the means of facilitating
the Conquest, just before it was put in Execution. His Advice was of
use, and he gave it, as one so nearly concern&rsquo;d; for besides the
Inheritance the King of <i>Ternate</i> wrongfully with-held from him,
he hop&rsquo;d to recover the Island of <i>Moutil</i>, which
belong&rsquo;d to his Forefathers. The Enterprize was farther
Authoriz&rsquo;d by the Presence of <i>Don John Ronquillo</i>,
<span class="marginnote">Don John Ronquillo <i>joyn&rsquo;d with</i>
Sarmiento.</span> the Governour&rsquo;s Nephew, who had equal Power
with <i>Sarmiento</i>, both by Sea and Land. If any thing was wanting,
they thought the Defect would easily be supply&rsquo;d by the Valour of
the Soldiers, the Celerity of the Passage, and the Enemies Surprize;
but the divided Command was an Obstacle to their Hopes.</p>
<p>The Weather prov&rsquo;d not very cross, yet neither was it so
favourable, as that they could come directly to anchor at
<i>Ternate</i>, as would have been most convenient to deceive the
Watchfulness of the Enemy. They arriv&rsquo;d at <i>Moutil</i>, and
fought a Parcel of <i>Janguas</i> in Sight of Land; which <span class=
"marginnote">Spaniards <i>arrive at and take</i> Moutil.</span>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=
"pb113">113</a>]</span>were taken, and the Christians in them set at
Liberty. <i>Paul de Lima</i> being well acquainted with the Bays, and
there being no sufficient Force in the Island to withstand a Fleet, it
easily submitted, when attack&rsquo;d in several Parts. The Natives
came out with Palm, Citron, and Clove-Tree Branches, in Token of Peace,
and to beg Pardon. Both were granted, and <i>Paul de Lima</i> appointed
their Lord, tho&rsquo; his New Dominion turn&rsquo;d to little Account,
for within a few Days, all the People slipp&rsquo;d away, either
because they thought themselves safer at <i>Ternate</i>, or to meet the
Enemy, who of Necessity must carry the War over into that Island, as it
happen&rsquo;d. Here <i>Sarmiento</i> refitted the Ships, and being
over-joy&rsquo;d with this Success, <span class="marginnote">Sarmiento
<i>in</i> Ternate.</span> obtain&rsquo;d without the Loss of one Man,
arriv&rsquo;d at <i>Talangame</i>, passing amidst the Enemies
<i>Carcoas</i>, which they had fitted out in a Hurry. The King expected
him long before in the Fort, well furnish&rsquo;d with our Cannon,
particularly the Bastion they had enlarg&rsquo;d, and call&rsquo;d
<i>Cachil Tulo</i>, from the King&rsquo;s Uncle, who made it, and these
Preparations seem&rsquo;d to threaten any Disaster. Our Men landed on
that Side, and were oppos&rsquo;d by the <i>Ternates</i>; but Night put
an End to the Fight, and both Parties retiring to their Fastnesses, our
Cannon was landed, and planted in the Place, and after such Manner as
<i>Paul de Lima</i> directed, and ever since he commanded it in the
Fort of <i>Tydore</i>. The King of this Island was willing to joyn our
Camp, as had appear&rsquo;d by some of his Actions, and his Promises to
the Ensign <i>Duennas</i>; but he mistrusted the Fortune of the
<i>Spaniards</i>, as if he <span class="marginnote"><i>King of</i>
Tydore <i>dubious</i>.</span> had not had sufficient Experience of it.
The Opportunity and Fidelity now invited him, and yet he forbore; his
Doubtfulness is thought to have been prejudicial to the Success.
<i>Sarmiento</i> having planted his Cannon, intrench&rsquo;d himself,
and taking some Prisoners, of whom he learn&rsquo;d what Provisions and
Amunition the Besieged had, began to press on, and batter them
furiously; yet they were not discourag&rsquo;d, but answer&rsquo;d
boldly. It was found convenient to possess the upper Grounds, which
over-looking the Place, tho&rsquo; they have been since levell&rsquo;d,
our Men much incommoded the Enemy, and had they continu&rsquo;d it,
that would have put an End to the War. However there was so much
Sickness in the Camp, that no Remedy <span class="marginnote"><i>Fort
of</i> Ternate <i>batter&rsquo;d</i>.</span> was found against it, but
going off so to save themselves for a more favourable Season. The
Succours which came as Duties from <i>Tydore</i>, were very
inconsiderable; the Allies were cold, and all Things weak; what other
Causes there were Heaven knows. It is likely there were some of
<span class="marginnote"><i>The Siege raised.</i></span> more Moment,
for in short the Army broke up, and reimbark&rsquo;d for <i>Manila</i>,
without doing any thing but adding to the Enemies Resolution.</p>
<p>At that Time, only the <i>English</i> Nation disturb&rsquo;d the
<i>Spanish</i> Sovereignty in those Eastern Parts; for this Reason,
King <i>Philip</i> was desirous, not only for the present to curb them
by Force of Arms, but to make them an Example to all other Nations,
that they might not spread themselves abroad to attempt such Invasions,
as we are Eye-Witnesses to. This Work was undertaken in the Year 1588,
but first happen&rsquo;d what we are now to <span class=
"marginnote"><i>State of Affairs in</i> Europe.</span> relate. Queen
<i>Elizabeth</i> of <i>England</i>, after a tedious Imprisonment,
beheaded <i>Mary Stuart</i>, Queen of <i>Scotland</i>, for some
Politick Reasons, or Fictions. The then King of <i>Scotland</i>, and
since of <i>England</i> also, Son to the Martyr, arm&rsquo;d his
People, strengthen&rsquo;d his Garrisons, and invaded the Dominions of
the Enemy, who had caus&rsquo;d him to be Motherless; and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span>more
particularly the Marches about the River <i>Tweed</i>, and those of
<i>Anandale</i>, water&rsquo;d by the River <i>Solway</i>. The Queen
call&rsquo;d Home the Earl of <i>Leicester</i>, who was in
<i>Holland</i>, appointed him General, and War broke out in all those
Northern Provinces, with apprehensions of greater to ensue.
<span class="marginnote"><i>Queen</i> Elizabeth<i>&rsquo;s</i>
<i>Practices</i>.</span> After many Events, which do not belong to this
Place, Queen <i>Elizabeth</i> strengthned her Alliance with the
<i>Dutch</i>, encouraging those Provinces to persist in their
Disobedience to the Church, and to King <i>Philip</i>, and advising
them, since the King had forbid them trading in all the Rest of his
Dominions, to go over into <i>India</i>, there to raise Commotions, and
rob him of the Spice. The more safely to compass her Designs, she
supported the <i>Flemmings</i> Obstinacy, flattering herself with the
Hopes of a new Monarchy, for the acquiring whereof, she propos&rsquo;d
to make use of the Wealth yearly brought from the North and South Seas,
for <i>Spain</i>, the Robbing of which had already made an Addition to
her Power; as also of the Factories erected for Trade in the
<i>Moluccos</i>, <i>Banda</i>, <i>Sumatra</i>, <i>Ceylon</i>, and the
two <i>Javas</i>; where she kept Garrisons, in order to convert the
Friendship into Sovereignty.</p>
<p>King <i>Philip</i>, whose great Soul ever entertain&rsquo;d both
Forbearance, and <span class="marginnote"><i>King</i>
Philip&rsquo;<i>s</i> <i>mighty Fleet</i>.</span> Counsel,
resolv&rsquo;d to cut off the Heads of this <i>Hydra</i> at the Neck
they all sprung from. He gather&rsquo;d, for the Conquest of
<i>England</i>, the mightiest Fleet that has been seen on the Ocean in
our Days. Twenty Thousand fighting Men were put aboard tall Ships,
besides 9000 Sailors, with 1730 Pieces of Cannon, Abundance of
Ammunition, and Pikes and Fire-Arms for the Catholicks, who it was
hop&rsquo;d, as soon as they saw the <i>Spanish</i> Colours, would joyn
our Army. <i>Don Alonso Perez de Guzman</i>, Duke of <span class=
"marginnote"><i>And Army against</i> England.</span> <i>Medina
Sidonia</i> commanded in Chief, and was to joyn the Prince of
<i>Parma</i>, then Governour of <i>Flanders</i>, who had Commission to
raise another Army of 30000 Horse and Foot, with the Necessary
Provisions and Ammunition, which he was to transport at a fit Season to
that Point of <i>England</i>, where the <i>Thames</i> falls into the
Sea, to march thence to <i>London</i>, and there Arm the Catholicks.
But it was first requisite to beat the <i>English</i> at Sea, where
they were then powerful, and well acquainted with the proper Times to
sail and keep at Home. At the least they were to be terrify&rsquo;d,
that they might not dare to obstruct the Passage of the Troops, the
Prince of <i>Parma</i> had in readiness at <i>Dunkirk</i> and
<i>Newport</i>, or hinder their embarking, when the <i>Spanish</i>
Fleet should come thither to waft them over. <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e13304" title="Source: this">This</span> Fleet sail&rsquo;d from
<i>Lisbon</i> on the 19th of <i>May</i>, 1588, and as soon as out
<span class="marginnote"><i>They suffer by Storms.</i></span>
suffer&rsquo;d much by the Weather, so that three Gallies were cast
away, on the Coast of <i>Bayonne</i>. Abundance of the powder blew up;
and the General was oblig&rsquo;d to return to <i>Corunna</i>, to
refit; whence he could not get out till the 2d of <i>July</i>.</p>
<p>Being come into 48 Degrees of Latitude, he sent away <i>Don Lewis de
Guzman</i> to give Advice to the Prince of <i>Parma</i>, and on the
last of the same <span class="marginnote"><i>Arrive at the</i>
Lizard.</span> Month arriv&rsquo;d himself at the <i>Lizard</i>, in
<i>Cornwall</i>, where he lay by, and was certainly inform&rsquo;d,
that all the Enemy&rsquo;s Ships, being fifty in number, lay in
<i>Plymouth</i>. The <i>English</i> Admiral at Break of Day
discover&rsquo;d ours, <span class="marginnote">Spanish
<i>Shiptaker</i>.</span> and tho&rsquo; he wanted neither Strength, nor
Experience in Sea Affairs, he resolved to draw off and avoid ingaging,
but his Ships being lighter incommoded us in the Rear. In the Catholick
Fleet, a great Ship of <i>Guipuscoa</i> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb115" href="#pb115" name="pb115">115</a>]</span>blew up, and another
of <i>Andaluzia</i> spent her Main-Mast, in which Distress, two
<i>English</i> Ships attacking her, and those afterwards seconded by
others, in one of which Sir <i>Francis Drake</i> was, they took her.
There <i>Don Pedro de Valdes</i>, a <i>Spanish</i> Commander of known
Valour, and then Lieutenant General, was made Prisoner, with whom they
sent to <i>Plymouth</i>, a great Quantity of Crown Pieces, and fifty
Great Guns. About 400 <i>Spaniards</i> were kill&rsquo;d, and taken. On
the 2<i>d</i> and 4<i>th</i> of <i>August</i>, the Lord <i>Howard</i>,
and <i>Drake</i> joyn&rsquo;d their Squadrons, some write they had an
hundred Sail, all well Mann&rsquo;d, and light, with which they
infested ours, which were heavy, and encumber&rsquo;d, particularly the
<i>Portuguese</i> Galleon, call&rsquo;d the <i>S. John</i>, being the
greatest in the Fleet, and in it were <i>John Martinez de Recalde</i>,
the Count <i>de Paredes</i>, the Marques <i>de la Favara</i>, and other
Commanders of Note. However they got to the Isle of <i>Wight</i>,
whence the Duke sent away two Messengers to the Prince of <i>Parma</i>,
who was then at <i>Brussels</i>, desiring he would furnish him with
Powder and Ball, for the Defence of the Fleet, and imbark what Troops
he had ready. But he, either prevented by invincible Obstacles, or for
other Reasons, which have left that Princes Reputation <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Disappointment of the Fleet</i><span class="corr" id=
"xd21e13431" title="Not in source">.</span></span> expos&rsquo;d to
Censures, mov&rsquo;d so slowly, that what had been so maturely
concerted took no Effect. The Enemy boasting, that the Sea and Winds
had fought against us, in Vindication, as they said of their Cause,
made publick Rejoycings, firing their Cannon; and soon after the Queen
put forth a Proclamation to the same Effect, against which a certain
<i>English</i> Religious Man writ learnedly, by the Name of <i>Andrew
Philopator</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Dutch</i> who were in Confederacy with Queen
<i>Elizabeth</i>, seeing this Success, were encourag&rsquo;d to aspire
to greater Matters, renouncing their Religion, and their Sovereign,
attempting to usurp the Treasures of the <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e13448" title="Source: Eact">East</span>, <span class=
"marginnote"><i>The</i> Dutch <i>aspire</i>.</span> Mines, Spice,
Drugs, and Silks, as appears by their bold Voyages, wherein they have
endeavour&rsquo;d to follow the fresh Examples of the <i>English</i>,
and the ancient set them by <i>Columbus</i>, <i>Albuquerque</i>,
<i>Magellan</i>, <i>Gama</i>, and <i>Cortes</i>, as we shall see
hereafter. But, both they and the <i>English</i>, if they try the
Justice of their Cause by the Success of that Fleet, must be
oblig&rsquo;d to prefer the Cause of the Gentiles, when God for his
Secret Judgments permitted his own chosen People to be over-thrown.
Destruction is more glorious than Prosperity; and a religious Soul will
rather chuse to be cast down than Victorious, if an angry God is to
give it the Victory.</p>
<p>After this <i>Santiago de Vera</i> govern&rsquo;d the
<i>Philippine</i> Islands, and by special Order, arm&rsquo;d against
<i>Ternate</i>, where the <i>English</i> from that Time traded
<span class="marginnote"><i>Another Expedition from the</i>
Philippines.</span> with all possible Security. All Nations had settled
Factories except the <i>Javaneses</i> and <i>Lascarines</i>. Above 2500
<i>Mahometans</i> from <i>Mecca</i> preach&rsquo;d their Abominations.
They fear&rsquo;d nothing from <i>Portugal</i>, all their Apprehension
was from the <i>Spaniards</i>, who were newly ingag&rsquo;d to seek
Revenge. The King of <i>Ternate</i> well knew that <i>Sarmiento</i> and
<i>Ronquillo</i> would have taken it, had not Diseases prevented them.
When the News of fresh Preparations came to <i>Tydore</i>, it was
carry&rsquo;d over by Spies to <i>Ternate</i>. That King presently
call&rsquo;d together his Subjects, especially the Islanders of
<i>Machian</i> and <i>Homer</i>, who came in 40 <i>Carcoas</i>, because
their Islands were very populous. The Number had been greater, but that
the <span class="marginnote"><i>King of</i> Ternate
<i>prepares</i>.</span> King would not suffer more to be fitted out
than he demanded, for he could not conceal his Fear that they would
rebel, those Parts being full of Christians, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name="pb116">116</a>]</span>and
the Taxes he laid on the People intolerable. <i>Santiago de Vera</i>
appointed <i>John Morones</i> General, who wanted not for Conduct, nor
his Men for Valour, nor the Fleet for Cannon and Ammunition. But
whether Natural Ambition, or any other Accident was the Occasion of it,
there were such Divisions among them, that they had sufficient Grounds
to mistrust the Event, before they left <i>Manila</i>. They set sail
with fair Weather, and pass&rsquo;d the greatest Dangers of the Sea,
and when they thought themselves safest, all the Elements seem&rsquo;d
to conspire against the Fleet. They lost the Light, and their Reckning,
the Vessels were shatter&rsquo;d, and the greatest of <span class=
"marginnote">Spanish <i>Fleet loses a great Galleon</i>.</span> them
sunk, and all the Men lost. This was the Galleon <i>S. Hellen</i>,
which carry&rsquo;d the Guns to batter the Fort, and many other
Necessaries and Stores. For all this, they insisted upon proceeding,
and the King of <i>Bachian</i> assisted them with what Forces he had
rais&rsquo;d, under Colour of clearing the Sea of some Enemies; and
being a Christian baptiz&rsquo;d, lamented his departing from our holy
Faith, on Account of Persecution, and promis&rsquo;d the Restitution of
his Soul.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Spanish <i>General refuses the best
Advice</i>.</span> The Weather growing calm, when they were in Sight of
<i>Ternate</i>, the <i>Carcoas</i> durst not stand them, but fled at
the first Discharges, which they can do without receiving any Damage.
Therefore the two Kings, and <i>Paul de Lima</i>, advis&rsquo;d to fall
on in several Places. <i>Ferdinand Boto Machado</i>, Captain of a
Galleon, was of the same Opinion; but the General suspecting the
former, on Account of his Affinity, and the latter for the Friendship
he had lately contracted with the King of <i>Tydore</i>, whom he was
not well satisfy&rsquo;d with, would not follow their Advice;
alledging, That it was not convenient, by dividing the Forces, to
weaken them more than the Storm <span class="marginnote"><i>Besieges
the Fort of</i> Ternate.</span> had done. He laid Siege to the Fort,
but the Besieged being acquainted with the Condition of our Troops,
oppos&rsquo;d all their Assaults courageously, and scoff&rsquo;d and
laugh&rsquo;d at the insignificant Batteries. However our Men, whom the
Storms had depriv&rsquo;d of Necessaries for that Work, vented their
Spleen upon the <i>Javanese</i>. These valu&rsquo;d themselves upon
sallying out to Skirmish, being distinguishable by their Arms, and
manner of drawing up. The <i>Spaniards</i> handled them so roughly,
that they did little more during the War. Some Months were spent in
Fruitless Attempts, and if they had attack&rsquo;d the Country, but a
Culverine-Shot short of the Fort, at the Bay of <i>Limathao</i>, and
march&rsquo;d thence to attack the Fort behind, as the most
understanding desir&rsquo;d, it had been of good Consequence. But the
General <i>Morones</i>, putting all upon Experience without Forecast,
was satisfy&rsquo;d with fronting next the Sea, doing much Harm, which
was caus&rsquo;d by that first, and obstinate manner of attacking; and
that gave Way for Succours to go into the Natives, at other landing
Places, tho&rsquo; thirty Men at a small Distance might have prevented
it. This both the Kings maintain&rsquo;d, whose Valour, which ought to
be commended even in Enemies, if our General had pleas&rsquo;d, might
have given Success to this Undertaking. Besides that experience has
shown that fifty <i>Spaniards</i> have done as much upon Occasion, as
whole <i>Roman</i> Legions well arm&rsquo;d and disciplin&rsquo;d.</p>
<p><i>Morones</i> now perceiving that neither his Arms, nor his
Proposals had <span class="marginnote"><i>Sends some Men to the other
Fort.</i></span> any effect upon the Rebels, he resolv&rsquo;d to pass
over some of his Men against the other Fort, which, tho&rsquo; seated
on a Ground of difficult Access, seem&rsquo;d to be pregnable, because
built in Haste, a League from the former on a steep <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=
"pb117">117</a>]</span>Hill. On the Land Side of it is the Mountain,
and on the Back a Lake, and is of no use, because it does not defend
the City, which is open, and is <span class="marginnote">Javanese
<i>Ships burnt</i><span class="corr" id="xd21e13639" title=
"Not in source">.</span></span> only regarded for being near the old
Fort. Our Men went on chearfully, and the Defendants receiv&rsquo;d
them as well firing their Cannon, which gave a Check to the
<i>Spanish</i> Fury. Those in the other Fort, tho&rsquo; they made
little use of Fire-Arms, being compell&rsquo;d by Necessity,
ventur&rsquo;d to sally out to the Shore. To draw them to this
Resolution, some of our Men on a sudden set Fire to the <i>Junks</i>,
in which a great Number of <i>Javanese Indians</i> had come thither.
The Vessels, which were old blaz&rsquo;d up, without any Obstruction
from those who guarded them, but they referr&rsquo;d the Remedy to
their Weapons. They were in all about 3000 fighting Men, 1000 of them
had Muskets, whereof 200 were expert at them; the rest neither Pikes,
nor Lances, nor any other long sort of Arms, but only those they call
<i>Toranas</i>, about a Fathom in Length, like Darts, and some like
Arrows, which they cast by main Strength, with Canes and Strings,
wherewith they unexpectedly wound unarm&rsquo;d Men in Fight; because
they fly not out of a Bow, but are thrown strait forward, or over their
Heads. Others had only their <i>Campilanes</i>, or Cymiters, and
Shields. Many of them fought the more obstinately, confiding in their
Coats of Mail, and Head-Pieces, bought of the <i>Portugueses</i>; but
as soon as they clos&rsquo;d with our Men, they broke their Order, and
lost Courage. This Accident prov&rsquo;d a very great Obstacle, because
it diverted our Men from their double Design of pressing both Forts at
the same Time, so that the very Commanders were forc&rsquo;d to ingage.
<i>Morones</i> knew how to behave himself upon all Occasions, and the
<i>Spaniards</i> made such a Slaughter, that almost all the
<i>Javaneses</i> lay upon <span class="marginnote"><i>Bloody Victory
gain&rsquo;d by the</i> Spaniards.</span> the Spot. Those in the Forts
had not the Courage to fall in upon the Rear, tho&rsquo; they
pour&rsquo;d a Volley upon the Forces of <i>Tydore</i> and
<i>Bachian</i>, but with little Harm. This Victory was not gain&rsquo;d
without Effusion of Blood, yet they took Heart to hope for one more
compleat, at the Arrival of the Galeon from <i>India</i>, and
believ&rsquo;d that Addition of Strength would make amends for what
they lost in the Storm.</p>
<p>The Galeon arriv&rsquo;d at <i>Tydore</i>, better provided to carry
on the Trade, than the War. For this Reason, and because many of our
Men were Sick, or Wounded, <i>Morones</i> was oblig&rsquo;d to raise
the Siege, and dismiss those Kings, <span class="marginnote"><i>The
Siege rais&rsquo;d.</i></span> to whom he afterwards sent Presents of
<i>Spanish</i> Commodities, some Horses and Silks. It was since known
that tho&rsquo; the <i>Ternates</i> will endure much Hardship, they
were then so near press&rsquo;d, that Hunger must have subdu&rsquo;d
them, could our Men have stay&rsquo;d a little longer. They
embark&rsquo;d in Sight of the Enemy, who presently appear&rsquo;d in
the Field rejoycing, with Musick, and other Tokens of Victory. The
<i>Asiatick</i> Traders resorted to their Ports, and others from
<i>Europe</i>, but particularly their new Friends the <i>English</i>,
with whom they communicated the Joy of their Success.</p>
<p>They never made a good use of Peace and Quietness at <i>Ternate</i>,
as soon as <span class="marginnote"><i>Notable Practices.</i></span>
that was now restor&rsquo;d, the King was again at Variance with his
Unkles; which Fortune so improv&rsquo;d as to furnish an Opportunity
that might have been advantageous to our Designs, had not she thwarted
it. <i>Cachil Mandraxa</i> was the noblest of Sultan
<i>Aerio</i>&rsquo;s Sons, as born of the Queen they call
<i>Putriz</i>, which is the Chief. His Father would have had him
succeed in the Throne, but was disgusted at a Boldness which does not
use to be mislik&rsquo;d <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href=
"#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span>among Politicians. <i>Cachil
Mandraxa</i> was desperately in love with <i>Filola</i>, his Niece,
Daughter to the King his Brother; and that Princes did not refuse her
Unkles Courtship. The Father one Day found them talking together, in
the Apartment reserv&rsquo;d only for himself; and tho&rsquo; he was
satisfied their Conversation was within the Bounds of Decency, took
such an Aversion, that he depriv&rsquo;d him of the Succession. The
illegitimate Nephew Reign&rsquo;d, against the Will of all the Unkles,
who were near conspiring <span class="marginnote"><i>Subtilty of the
King of</i> Ternate.</span> to kill him; but the subtle King knew how
to disappoint their Designs, and secure himself without discovering the
Contrivance. He call&rsquo;d <i>Cachil Mandraxa</i> to him, and
repeating all past Distates, told him, how desirous he was to remove
all manner of Jealousies by a perfect Reconciliation, which he thought
might be done by means of the Princess <i>Filola</i>, and since there
was such a good Correspondence between them, all the Rest would be
easie. However before he gave her to him to Wife, he must reflect that
she was promis&rsquo;d to the King of <i>Tydore</i>, to whom he was not
willing to administer fresh Causes of War, or to be the Occasion of
interrupting that short Tranquility they enjoy&rsquo;d. That since all
they discours&rsquo;d there would remain in their Breasts, he would
have him to take his Advice. <i>Mandraxa</i> was beside himself, with
that unexpected Satisfaction, and yet had he been truly Master of
himself, he might easily have seen thro&rsquo; the Fraud of that
pleasing <span class="marginnote"><i>His crafty Words.</i></span>
Change in his Condition, wherein he found the King so much his Friend,
who but just before had been his Enemy. He thank&rsquo;d him for the
Favour, and putting his whole Dependance on the Words of his Mouth,
desir&rsquo;d he would give him the Advice he spoke of. The King
answer&rsquo;d, <i>I have contriv&rsquo;d a Way, which will satisfie
you, and the King of</i> Tydore <i>will have no Cause to complain. For
the attaining of both these Ends, I will keep Council, as is requisite,
and do you any Night steal away the Princess, the Way you shall best
like, so it be with Regard to my Reputation, and in all Respects giving
such outward Tokens, that all Men may believe it was open Violence, and
no Contrivance, or at least known to me, I, on my Side, will pretend to
be very Angry, and will complain of the Injury as loudly as is
requisite to satisfie the World of my Innocence. For why should I,
Unkle, wish for the Felicities of this World, but to make them common
to our Family? I will retain the Cares of the Crown, and do you enjoy
the Satisfaction the Kingdom affords.</i> <i>Mandraxa</i> could not
forbear Weeping for Joy, he fell down at his Nephew&rsquo;s Feet and
kiss&rsquo;d them, without disguizing any thing of his Passion, yet
suppressing the Joy of his new Hopes, the best he could, he found Means
to acquaint the Princess, and to appoint the Hour, Place, and
Confidents for exposing herself to be stolen away.</p>
<p>To this Purpose they pitch&rsquo;d upon a Garden, which looks out
upon the Sea, adorn&rsquo;d with its Natural Trees, whence the Ships
are seen, and among them, on the Day prefix&rsquo;d they spy&rsquo;d a
<i>Carcoa</i>, with all the Men that Row&rsquo;d curiously
dress&rsquo;d and they and the Soldiers wearing Garlands, plainly
show&rsquo;d the Design of their Voyage, tho&rsquo; they row&rsquo;d
without the Musick they use to have at other Times. <i>Mandraxa</i> and
a small but brave Number of his Friends landed as silently, and they
after the manner of <i>Talasio</i>, and the <span class=
"marginnote">Cachal Mandraxa <i>steals the Princess</i> Filola.</span>
ancient <i>Romans</i>, when they forc&rsquo;d away the <i>Sabine</i>
Women, laid Hold of <i>Filola</i> and the Rest, and run them aboard
with all possible Speed, conveying them to a strong Place in the
Island, where having fortify&rsquo;d himself, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name="pb119">119</a>]</span>like
a Soldier, <i>Mandraxa</i> devote himself to Love. Fame the utter Enemy
to Secrecy divulg&rsquo;d the Fact, and convey&rsquo;d it over to the
King of <i>Tydore</i>&rsquo;s Ears, with the King of
<i>Ternate</i>&rsquo;s Complaints. He magnify&rsquo;d the Affront, and
every Man spoke of it, according to his own Notion. The King who had
contriv&rsquo;d it, and by whose Breath all the Machines of that
Tragedy were mov&rsquo;d assembled the prime Men of his Kingdom, most
of them Enemies to the deluded <i>Mandraxa</i>, and ask&rsquo;d their
Assistance and Advice in so notorious a <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Base falsehood of the King.</i></span> Violence, and
pretending extraordinary Concern. They all Voted to a Man, that it was
absolutely necessary to make such an Example as might deter others from
the like. When the Consultation was over, the King dispatch&rsquo;d
Messengers to his Unkle, intreating him to repair to Court to stop ill
Mouths by fair Means, and appease the Neighbouring Princes. <i>Cachil
Mandraxa</i> made no difficulty to obey, as well knowing that none of
his Actions had been contrary to the King&rsquo;s Orders. Only the
Princess advis&rsquo;d the Contrary; for tho&rsquo; young, as little
above 20 years of Age, she was better acquainted with her Brother, and
well knew he never kept his Faith, particularly with his own Family,
and that he could not have any Kindness for them as being jealous of
the Crown. <i>Mandraxa</i> made no Account of all that, but went to
Court, and enter&rsquo;d the Palace attended by his Family, and relying
on the King&rsquo;s Promise, but more especially on the secret Mystery
of that Affair, known only to them two, Unkle and Nephew. When he came
to kiss the King&rsquo;s Hand, he looking as stern as if he had not
advis&rsquo;d the stealing of the Princess, said he knew not what
Course to take upon so notorious an Affront offer&rsquo;d to his Crown
and Palace, but to cut off his Head. <i>Mandraxa</i> thinking at first
that had been all Counterfeit, and according to what had been agreed
between them, when he perceiv&rsquo;d <span class="marginnote"><i>He
murders</i> Mandraxa.</span> it was barefac&rsquo;d falsehood, would
have spoke loud in Defence of his Innocence; but was not permitted, and
the King making a Sign to a Sturdy Black he had prepar&rsquo;d for that
Action, he drew his Cymiter, and hew&rsquo;d him down barbarously. The
poor Prince fell, without being reliev&rsquo;d by any Man; for at that
Time his Brothers <i>Cachil Tulo</i>, and <i>Cachil Sufur</i> were not
at <i>Ternate</i>, the former being Governor, the latter Admiral. Nor
did they come to <i>Ternate</i> in a long Time after, tho&rsquo; they
look Care to protect the Widow Princess, who was left with Child, and
afterwards brought forth <i>Cachil Amida</i>, who dy&rsquo;d Young.</p>
<p>The whole Truth of this Matter was soon known, with all its
Particulars, and Circumstances; and the <i>Cachiles</i> conferring
together, <i>Tulo</i> resolv&rsquo;d to go over to the Service of King
<i>Philip</i>, to which Purpose, when <span class="marginnote"><i>The
King&rsquo;s Unkles conspire against him.</i></span> <i>Duarte
Pereyra</i> was Commander in Chief at <i>Tydore</i>, he went thither to
treat with him, and with <i>Antony de Matos</i>, who went first for the
same End to <i>Bachian</i>; but forasmuch as what was concerted among
them, will better appear by the Letter <i>Cachil Tulo</i> sent from
<i>Tydore</i> to the Governour <i>Santiago de Vera</i>, we will here
insert it, translated From the <i>Malaye</i> Language, by the
King&rsquo;s <i>Naguatatos</i>, so they there call the
Interpreters.</p>

will not perform what his Father, my Brother and I promised to his
Majesty, I am resolv&rsquo;d from this Time forward, to become his
Majesty&rsquo;s sincere Subject and Servant. And I do by these
Presents, oblige my self, and swear by my Law, at I did swear; and do
not depart from it, to the Father Vicar</i> Antony Ferreyra, <i>to give
all my Help and Assistance, towards the taking of the Fort, with all my
Kindred and Friends, till it shall be in the Possession of his
Majesty&rsquo;s Commander, or whosoever shall come with the</i>
Portugueses, <i>or</i> Spaniards <i>that attend him; upon Condition,
that the Commander, or Commanders, shall, in his Majesty&rsquo;s Name,
perform what</i> Duarte Pereyra, <i>the Commander in chief
promis&rsquo;d me and sign&rsquo;d for him, I having given him a
Counterpart; which is, that I shall be proclaim&rsquo;d King of</i>
Ternate, <i>as soon as Possession is taken of the Fort for his Majesty;
both in regard it belongs to me in Right of my Father, and of the
Service I now do, and hereafter hope to do his Majesty. I therefore beg
it as a Favour of your Lordship, and require you in his Majesty&rsquo;s
Name, that you take Care to send the greatest Number of Men you
possibly can, and with the greatest Expedition; to the End that this my
Intention, and Will to serve his Majesty herein may be effectual, which
I hope will be without the Expence of Lives; notwithstanding the Fort
is well fortify&rsquo;d, as your Lordship may have been inform&rsquo;d.
The Commander in chief, will write to your Lordship, what Season and
Order those Forces are to observe. Given at</i> Tydore, <i>to which
Place I am come to this Intent, as will be testify&rsquo;d by the
Father Vicar</i> Antony Ferreyra, <i>and the Judge</i> Antony de Matos,
<i>whom, as Persons of such Note, I desir&rsquo;d to sign for me.</i>
May <i>the</i> 23d.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Nunno Pereyra<i>&rsquo;s Perswasions to the
same Governor</i>.</span> At the Bottom of the Letter, the Vicar and
<i>Matos</i> certify&rsquo;d his Hand and Subscription. With this came
another very long one, wherein <i>Duarte Pereyra</i> gives the
Governour a more ample Account of what is here deliver&rsquo;d briefly,
representing to him the Opportunity offer&rsquo;d in forcible Terms. He
tells him that <i>Mandraxa</i> a little before his Death, had
propos&rsquo;d the same thing to him, that his Brother <i>Tulo</i> now
did; and that they were desirous to fulfill what they promis&rsquo;d
<i>Nunno Pereyra</i>. That the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121"
href="#pb121" name="pb121">121</a>]</span>Island of <i>Machian</i>, the
most fruitful in Clove, Espous&rsquo;d the Party that was against the
King. That they could no longer endure their Oppression. He perswaded
him to Arm 400 <i>Spaniards</i>, if they were come from <i>Mexico</i>,
<span class="corr" id="xd21e13994" title="Source: anto">and to</span>
Ship them off for the Expedition upon <i>Ternate</i>, giving out, that
they were going to clear those Seas from <i>Javaneses</i>, whose
Friendship the People of <i>Ternate</i> value more than they do ours.
That besides the good Success he expected by the Help of those Forces,
they would at least secure those Ports against the <i>English</i>, the
People of <i>Ternate</i> having always a Fleet in Readiness. That the
Enterprize might succeed with Fifteen Frigates, and one Galeon,
provided they went to stay a Year at the <i>Moluccos</i>, and brought a
Number of <i>Philippine</i> Pioneers. He says, the <i>Javanese</i>
Ships are less than the Frigats, and there are Forty Soldiers in each
of them, who lye Aboard Eight Months, and live a Year upon 300 Bushels
of Rice. That in Case the Frigates could not hold the Men, they should
bring some Junks, which are necessary Vessels to Transport Provisions
from the Islands of <i>Burro</i> and <i>Bachian</i>. He complains of
the King of <i>Tydore</i>&rsquo;s ill Behaviour, and his Avarice; of
<i>Sancho de Vasconcelos</i>, and <i>James de Azambuja</i>, who built
the Fort of <i>Tydore</i> in an ill place. He commends the King of
<i>Bachian</i>, and says he in private lives like a Christian. Among
these Things he intermixes many more, all of them tending to perswade
the Expedition of <i>Ternate</i>, to blot out the last Disgrace,
without any Expence to the King, through <i>Cachil Tulo</i>&rsquo;s
Contrivance.</p>
<p>The Governour receiv&rsquo;d this Dispatch, and he would willingly
have put it in Execution immediately; but as it went on slowly, and the
Death <span class="marginnote"><i>The Projects for executing the
Design.</i></span> of <i>Cachil Tulo</i> happened in the mean while, it
was requisite to delay the Design, and attend to the Preservation of
the <i>Philippine</i> Islands, against the Machinations of the
<i>Chineses</i> and <i>Japoneses</i>, against whose Robberies and
Burnings they are never secure. Each of these Attempts harass&rsquo;d
the Province with the Expence of Treasure, and Power, so that there was
a necessity of breathing to recover both. It was thought the most
proper Advice to joyn from the <i>Philippines</i> and <i>Malaca</i>,
with equal Force, coming from both Parts to Arm in the <i>Moluccos</i>,
which was the Boundary of both Provinces. This took Effect some Years
after, Captain <i>Andrew Furtado</i> coming from <i>Malaca</i>, of
whose Actions it will be proper to begin to speak to give a Reputation
to his Person.</p>
<p><i>Andrew Furtado de Mendoza</i> might have Ennobled his Family, had
it <span class="marginnote">Andrew Furtado <i>his Actions</i>.</span>
not been of antient Quality. He was the Terror of those Eastern Parts,
where he serv&rsquo;d the King ever since the Year 1576, subduing
Barbarous Nations. In the Year 1587 he was the Governour of the Fort of
<i>Rachol</i>, till he came to have that of <i>Malaca</i>. Whilst he
was in the first, some Villages of Gentiles rose up against the
Ministers of the Church, disturbing Christianity with Warlike
Disorders. <i>Furtado</i> pacify&rsquo;d them with Severity, and his
Authority. In 1591 <i>Furtado</i> was Commander of the
<i>Portuguese</i> Soldiery in that <i>Archipelago</i>, and was very
earnest to employ them in the Recovery of <i>Ternate</i>; but was
hinder&rsquo;d by other Wars, which he concluded Victoriously. In
<i>August</i> that same Year, he was inform&rsquo;d that Eighteen
Galeons had put out of <i>Cunnal</i>, Commanded by <i>Cutumaza</i>,
assisted by <i>Raju</i>, with a Design to Besiege the Fort of
<i>Ceylon</i>. This <i>Cutumaza</i> had the Year before Burnt a Ship of
ours, Sailing for <i>China</i>, and made <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb122" href="#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span>dismal Havock on the
Coast of <i>Coromandel</i>. <i>Furtado</i> went out in Search of the
Enemies Fleet, and by the way reliev&rsquo;d the Fort of <i>Ceylon</i>;
and on the Coast of <i>Malabar</i> he met three Ships Bound from
<i>Mecca</i> for <i>Cunnal</i>. He fought them, and Sunk two, the Sea
running so high, that the Vessels which Row&rsquo;d could not attack
them. The other after a long Dispute yielded to him. This Victory was a
sufficient Revenge for the Burning of our Ships. Continual War is
maintain&rsquo;d in these Parts, which Neighbour upon <i>Malaca</i>;
and that in <i>Ceylon</i> never ceases, contrary to the Advice of
Persons that are well acquainted with <i>India</i>; because the best
Product of that Island being the Cinnamon, a Commodity of less Durance
than the Mace, Clove and Pepper, they look upon almost all the expence
laid upon <i>Ceylon</i>, as good as thrown away. Besides that the
greatest Commanders are employ&rsquo;d in suppressing the continual
Rebellions of those most inconstant People, without stretching out, at
least as far as the <i>Moluccos</i>, by their Absence encouraging their
Tyranny, and giving Opportunity to Nations that are our Enemies to fix
themselves in our Forts.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Ceylon <i>describ&rsquo;d</i>.</span>
<i>Ceylon</i> is one of the most Remarkable Islands In the World, and
the most fruitful. It lies opposite to Cape <i>Comorin</i>, Nobly
Inhabited, and cultivated. In it grow all Plants, known in all other
Parts of the World, Nutmegs, Pepper, Cinnamon, and the most Excellent
call&rsquo;d <i>Mosyllion</i> grows in this Island. Here is Wild and
Garden Fruit, <i>Spanish</i> Figs, and Grapes, and the best Oranges in
all <i>Asia</i>. There are whole Woods of mighty Palm-Trees. The
Variety of Flowers, would take up much Time to describe it; as also of
Grain known to us, Wheat, Rice, and Flax, of which and their Cotton,
they make wonderful Webs. It has all sorts of Precious Stones, Gold,
Silver, Steel, Tin, Iron, and Seed Pearl. Several <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Product.</i></span> Christaline Rivers, and Fountains
moisten it, with delightful and Medicinal Waters, of Excellent
Qualities. And among the rest there are Springs of Liquid Bitumen,
thicker than our Oyl, and some of pure Balsam. There are Burning
Mountains continually blazing, and casting out Clods of Brimstone among
the Crags of the Hills; where there are Groves <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Birds.</i></span> of Tall Trees, on whose Branches are
to be seen all sorts of Birds that fly in other Parts of the World, and
among them our Turkys, Wild Hens, <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Beasts.</i></span> and Pidgeons. It abounds in Deer,
Wild-Boars, Tygers, Lions, and <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Elephants.</i></span> Elephants of so Noble a Kind,
that all others submit to them. Those that are bred in this Island have
such an Extraordinary Natural Instinct, that it verifies what
<i>Aristotle</i>, <i>Plutarch</i>, <i>Athen&aelig;us</i>,
<i>&AElig;lian</i>, <i>Pliny</i>, and others, who have Writ Natural
History testifie, and is, that whether it proceeds from Knowledge, or
Habit, they partake of the Wit, Sense, and even of the Prudence of Men.
We are told they have so much Sense of Honour, that they will not go
Aboard a Ship, if they imagine they are carry&rsquo;d to serve Princes
in strange Countries, and that they obey, if their Owners swear they
will bring them back to their own. That they are concern&rsquo;d at
abusive Words given them. That they pay a sort of Religious Respect to
the Sun and Moon. That they remember such Things as they conceive; and
<i>Gellius</i> perswades us we may believe, that at Night they bewail
their Servitude with doleful Complaints; and if any Man happens to come
near in the Height of their Lamentation, they with shame suppress their
Sighs; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name=
"pb123">123</a>]</span>and in short, they seem feasible of the Iniquity
of their Fate. In this Country it is their Part to load and unload
Ships, the Weight of Commerce, whether Arms, Metals, Provisions, or
other Commodities whatsoever hanging on their Teeth, or lying on their
Necks. They are more willing to carry Arm&rsquo;d Men on their Backs,
in great Castles built to that purpose. They serve the
<i>Chingalas</i>, not as they did in <i>Rome</i> at publick Shows, but
in Battel, as they did the <i>Carthaginians</i>, and afterwards the
<i>Romans</i>. The People of <i>Ceylon</i> believe their Country is the
Terrestrial <span class="marginnote"><i>Opinion that</i> Paradise <i>is
in</i> Ceylon.</span> Paradise. They call the Top of a certain Mountain
<i>Adam&rsquo;s Point</i>, and on it, they say, is to be seen the Print
of his Foot, and that there he did <span class="corr" id="xd21e14265"
title="Source: Pennnance">Pennance</span>. Upon this Belief, the
<i>Jogues</i>, who are penitent Pilgrims, visit that Point, where they
affirm there grows a thick Tree, of an indifferent <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Strange Tree.</i></span> Height, with small rough
Leaves, of a dusty Colour, the Bark Ash-colour&rsquo;d, which in the
Night shines, and dispells Darkness. Under Colour of this Superstition,
all the Gangs of strowling Players or Actors, come <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Players.</i></span> out of this Island, and travel
throughout all <i>India</i>, representing their Fables, with odd
Gestures, and Dancing to little Flat Tabors, Bag-pipes, and Rattles of
small Bells. Abundance of Pearls are found about it. The Gold and other
Metals are kept untouch&rsquo;d in the Mines, by publick Law, and yet
notwithstanding this Precaution, they are not free from War and
Oppression. The Natives are call&rsquo;d <i>Chingalas</i>, and resemble
the <i>Malabars</i> in Customs and Countenances. They have broad Noses,
but are not so black, and go naked, but not to immodesty. Formerly they
had but one King, who was dispossess&rsquo;d by Force, and Treachery,
and the Kingdom <span class="marginnote"><i>King&rsquo;s
expell&rsquo;d.</i></span> divided among many. Division having thus
weaken&rsquo;d them, a Barbarian, call&rsquo;d <i>Raju</i>,
tyrannically expell&rsquo;d the King&rsquo;s the Island; one of whom
was by the Magnificence of the Kings of <i>Portugal</i> bred at
<i>Goa</i>.</p>
<p><i>Raju</i> was a subtle Soldier, and jealous even of those that
supported him. He had some Years before, besieg&rsquo;d the Fort of
<i>Columbo</i>, with a great Body of Foot, Elephants and Horse.
<i>Andrew Furtado</i> being in search of the Enemies Fleet, in
Prosecution of his Revenge for the Ships lost, to relieve <span class=
"marginnote">Furtado <i>relieves</i> Columbo.</span> the Fort of
<i>Columbo</i>, doubled Cape <i>Comorin</i>, thro&rsquo; the Streight
of <i>Ceylon</i>, at the Time when it is usually most difficult and
dangerous for Tall Ships, much more for such Vessels as use Oars. He
came to the Fort so opportunely, that had he stay&rsquo;d never so
little longer it had been lost, for most of the Garrison had
mutiny&rsquo;d against their Commander in Chief <i>Simon de Brito</i>
who was wounded by them with two Musket Balls. <i>Raju</i> was marching
with all Expedition by Land to <i>Columbo</i> for fear of slipping the
Opportunity offer&rsquo;d him of taking Possession of it.
<i>Cutumuza</i> lay with all his Fleet in the River <i>Cordiva</i>,
distant from the Fort ready to attack it by Sea, when <i>Raju</i> fell
on by Land. <i>Furtado</i> was before-hand with him, and getting in,
dispos&rsquo;d all Things for its Defence. He quell&rsquo;d the Mutiny,
punish&rsquo;d the Ring-leaders, satisfy&rsquo;d such as had just Cause
of Complaint or had been wrong&rsquo;d, and with all possible Speed
went out to find <i>Cunale</i>&rsquo;s Fleet. Nor was he disappointed,
for the Enemy did not offer <span class="marginnote"><i>Beat, the</i>
Indian <i>Fleet</i>.</span> to fly, but met him, with his Ships drawn
up in good Order, and after Cannonading, they laid one another aboard,
where there was an obstinate Fight on both Sides, till
<i>Cunnale&rsquo;s</i> Navy was defeated. <i>Furtado</i> took 14
Galeons, with all their Artillery, and Men, besides Abundance
kill&rsquo;d. The Admiral <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href=
"#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span>fled with only four Ships of 18 he
had, and made to <i>Raju</i>&rsquo;s Country. This Victory was
sufficient Satisfaction for the Damage receiv&rsquo;d by that
rebellious Fleet, the ill Success whereof discourag&rsquo;d <i>Raju</i>
from coming to besiege <i>Columbo</i>, so that he retir&rsquo;d and
dismiss&rsquo;d his Army.</p>
<p>Not long after, <i>Furtado</i> was inform&rsquo;d by his Spyes, that
the King of <i>Jasanapatan</i> had concluded a League with <i>Raju</i>,
pressing him to return to the Siege of <i>Columbo</i>, whilst he did
the same to <i>Mana</i>. That his Presumption might not want such
Punishment, as became the Honour of the Crown of <i>Portugal</i>, and
the Reputation of its Grandeur, which is more prevalent in those Parts
than Force, <i>Furtado</i> gathering what Power he could, with all
possible Celerity attack&rsquo;d that King. He was not unprovided, but
drawing <span class="marginnote"><i>Routs him, and subdues his
Kingdom.</i></span> up without the Walls of that City, offer&rsquo;d
him Battel, his Men, Elephants and Horses covering spacious Fields.
<i>Furtado</i> playing both Parts of a Commander, and a Soldier, drew
up his Forces, encourag&rsquo;d them in few Words; and both Sides
coming to the Charge exercis&rsquo;d their Force and Fury; but at
Length the King&rsquo;s Troops were routed, and he slain entering the
City, in which abundance of Brass Cannon was found, besides the
Plunder, which was considerable. He took Possession of it, and seizing
the Forts and Garrisons, carry&rsquo;d on the War there in such Manner,
that the whole Kingdom seeing such severe Execution, and feeling it so
heavily within its Bowels, submitted to the King of <i>Spain</i>. By
his Authority, when the Sword was put up, he appointed a Kinsman of the
late King, to whom of Right it belonged, to reign in
<i>Jasanapatan</i>, he having been taken in the last Battel. He
caus&rsquo;d him to swear and plight his Faith, that he would be a
perpetual Vassal to his Majesty; imposing on him the Payment of a
yearly Tribute, which still subsists. The Writings containing this
Settlement were sent by him into <i>Spain</i>, where and at <i>Goa</i>,
all that had been done was approv&rsquo;d of by the Viceroy, and the
Conqueror, who had concluded it so happily, highly applauded.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Ternate <i>the Cause of
Rebellions</i>.</span> He next Strengthned the Fort of <i>Columbo</i>,
with Four Ships of his Fleet, and 100 Soldiers; and Supply&rsquo;d
<i>Cosme de la Feta</i> with Eighty Men, under Two Captains, to
prosecute the Affair of <i>Candia</i>, which was committed to him, and
sorted good effect. No Rebellion broke out in those Parts, but what was
either supported by <i>Ternate</i>, or proceeded from its Example, and
great Celerity was requisite in the Commanders for suppressing of
it.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Coast of Pearl Fishery Rebells, and is
reduc&rsquo;d.</i></span> At this same Time all the Coast of the Pearl
Fishery rebell&rsquo;d, and among other sudden Destruction usually made
by Seditious Men in Arms, the Subjects of <i>Vinapanaique</i> burnt
Twenty five Christian Churches. <i>Furtado</i> made all possible speed
to chastize them before the Rebellion grew to a Head. The Mutineers not
being well Strengthned, sent Embassadors to him, begging Peace, and
colouring their Guilt with Excuses, which <i>Furtado</i> admitted of
because it was convenient for his Majesties Service; upon Condition
they should make good all the Damages occasion&rsquo;d by their Revolt.
He commanded them to rebuild the Churches they had destroy&rsquo;d, and
to grant the Society of the <i>Jesuits</i>, who had then the Charge of
the Christians in that Country, all the Liberties and Immunities
demanded by those then residing there; taking sufficient Hostages for
the Performance. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125"
name="pb125">125</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Furtado <i>ill us&rsquo;d would depart</i>
India.</span> These and other no less notable Actions, he
perform&rsquo;d in the space of four Months; but as Envy seldom fails
to oppose Valour, when he came to <i>Cochin</i>, and was there ready to
set out for the Conquest of the <i>Moluccos</i>, and particularly of
<i>Ternate</i>, he received Letters from the Viceroy, <i>Matthias de
Albuquerque</i> commanding him to deliver up the Fleet to <i>Nunno
Vello Pereyra</i>. He obey&rsquo;d, and when he came to <i>Goa</i>, was
Imprisoned, and put to Trouble. As soon as it was in his Power, he
resolv&rsquo;d to depart <i>India</i>, and remove himself from the
ill-will of those he thought were not his Friends; but the City of
<i>Goa</i> conjur&rsquo;d him not to forsake it, and in vain
endeavour&rsquo;d to procure a Reconciliation betwixt those Commanders.
This happened in the Year 1592, when, and some Years after,
<i>Ternate</i> might have been reliev&rsquo;d, as <i>Furtado</i>
desir&rsquo;d, had not the Animosities reigning obstructed it. However
they were so far from employing him, that, tho&rsquo; <i>Furtado</i>
several times Offer&rsquo;d himself, with his own Ships, and at his
proper Cost, where there was such Necessity of suppressing
<i>Cunnale</i>, yet he was as often Rejected, and that Victory
envy&rsquo;d him, which afterwards he had granted by Heaven, as we
shall see in its Place.</p>
<p>At this Time <i>Santiago de Vera</i> was discharged of his Command
of the <i>Philippine</i> Islands. He had signified his Intentions to
<i>Andrew Furtado</i>, and received his Answer, That he would comply
with his Desires; but Fortune disappointed these good Beginnings,
embroiling <i>Furtado</i> with those who did not love him, and removing
<i>Santiago</i> from his Government. His Successor was <i>Gomez Perez
de las Marinnas</i>, Knight of the Order of <i>Santiago</i>,
<span class="marginnote">Gomez Perez <i>Governor of the</i>
Philippines.</span> or St. <i>James</i> the Apostle, a Person of high
Reputation, born at <i>Betanzos</i>, in the Kingdom of <i>Galicia</i>.
He arriv&rsquo;d at the <i>Philippines</i> in the Year 1590, and
brought with him his Son <i>Don Lewis</i>, Knight of the Order of
<i>Alcantara</i>. The new Governor found <i>Manila</i> open, without
any Form of a City, and without Wealth to Improve it. Above 200000
Pieces of Eight were wanting for this Purpose; yet he compass&rsquo;d
the Work by Projects, and Contrivance without any Dammage to the
Publick, or to private Persons. He Monopoliz&rsquo;d the Cards; he laid
Penalties on excessive Gaming, and punish&rsquo;d such as
Forestal&rsquo;d the Markets, and on Victuallers, and other Retailers
of that Sort that were guilty of Frauds; with these Fines he built the
Walls of <i>Manila</i>, which are 12849 Geometrical Foot in Compass,
<span class="marginnote"><i>He Walls</i> Manila; <i>Builds Forts</i>,
&amp;c.</span> each Foot being the third part of a Yard. He
apply&rsquo;d himself diligently to this Work, and the Inhabitants
attended it, being willing to forward it on Account of the Intreaties
and Example of their Chief. The City had but one Fort, and that ill
built, wherefore he Erected another at the Mouth of the River, calling
it <i>Santiago</i>, and enclosed the old one. He finish&rsquo;d the
Cathedral, and built from the Ground the Church of St.
<i>Potenciana</i>, Patroness of the Island, for Women that have
retir&rsquo;d from the World. Then he apply&rsquo;d himself to casting,
and brought able Artists, who furnish&rsquo;d the Place with heavy and
small Cannon; built Galleys to Cruize and Trade, whereon depends the
Welfare of those Countries; and pursuant to what he had promis&rsquo;d
in <i>Spain</i>, bent his Thoughts towards <i>Ternate</i>, and all the
<i>Moluccos</i>; reflected on the Disreputation of the unfortunate
Expeditions of his Predecessors, who attempted the Conquest of that
flourishing Kingdom, and how he might punish those who Tyranniz&rsquo;d
in it.</p>
<p>He imparted his Thoughts by Word of Mouth, and by Letters to Zealous
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name=
"pb126">126</a>]</span><span class="marginnote"><i>His first Steps for

<i>F. Marta</i>, a Priest of the Society of <i>Jesus</i>, and a grave
and active Man, whose Experience and Doctrine had been very
Advantageous in those Parts. This Religious Man furnish&rsquo;d him
with Intelligence, Advice, and proper Ministers to prepare and carry on
the Work; one of whom was Brother <i>Gaspar Gomez</i>, a
<i>Spaniard</i>, and Lay-Brother of the said Society. Among the many
Conferences there were to this Effect, I find an Exhortation of <i>F.

Large and Wealthy Kingdom, since all this</i> Archipelago <i>of the</i>
Moluccos <i>and</i> Amboina, <i>as far as</i> Banda, <i>which is above
130 Leagues in Length and 70 in Breadth, is an inexhaustible Source of
Clove, Nutmeg, and Mace, which will afford his Majesty a Yearly Income
of 200000 Crusados</i>, which is about 27000 Pounds Sterling, then a
considerable sum, <i>in</i> India <i>alone; besides that of other
Islands, which produce no Clove. Nor will it require any Expence,
because the Country it self will freely afford it on its very
Mountains; and what is yet much more, your Lordship will gain above
200000 Souls to God, all which, in a short time, after subduing the
Kingdom, will become Christians, without any, or with very little
Opposition; whereby your Lordship will have a burning Flambeau in this
World, to light and conduct you to Heaven. Besides, you will magnify

that they durst afterwards daily Cruize in sight of the Fort, took the
Fishermen that went out in the Morning to follow their Trade, and laid
a Ground some</i> Carcoas <i>on the Shore. They erected a Mosque
opposite to the Fort, as in a safe Place, and thus they kept the Fort
Besieged with Contempt, for the space of a Month. At the end thereof,
the Galley going out, with one Galiot we had left, made them fly, every
one to his own Country, giving out, and threatning, That they would
Return next Year with a greater Fleet, which will be about</i>
September. <i>We are certainly assured that the People of</i> Banda,
<i>left 50 of their prime Men at</i> Amboyna, <i>as Hostages for the
performance of their Engagement. This is also known by a Man of our
own, who fled from</i> Banda, <i>having been carry&rsquo;d thither
Prisoner from</i> Amboyna. <i>We are informed, that 25 Carcoas would
set out, so many being Launch&rsquo;d, and they were to Sail after
their Lent, which is at the End of this Month of</i> July, <i>and to
joyn the</i> Seyrves, <i>and the rest of the Confederates, in order to
return again before the Fort of</i> Amboyna. <i>If they come with such
a Force, I am very suspitious that the Fort will be lost; because the
Enemies method is to take in all the Towns that are Subject to it; and
when this is left alone, wanting the Support of its Neighbours, it must
of necessity Surrender.</i> Antony Perez, <i>the Governor of that Fort,
is a Man of Courage, and well Fortified; and yet there are
Circumstances to be consider&rsquo;d, some of them very Difficult; as
that the Enemies are Numerous, and there will come some Confederates
with them, who are fit for any piece of Treachery; besides, that they
cannot be Reliev&rsquo;d from any Part whatsoever, for the full space
of five Months, that is till the beginning of</i> January <i>next. We
cannot but apprehend some great Mischief will happen; for supposing
they do not take the Fort, still this War is Dangerous, as being
Universal, with all the</i> Moors; <i>stirr&rsquo;d up by means of
the</i> Caciques; <i>Concerted under solemn Oaths; and Declar&rsquo;d
to be Religious, with full Remission of Sins to all that Die in it.
There is no want of Fomenters, and those</i> Caciques <i>of Note, and
<span class="marginnote"><i>General Conspiracy against
Christians.</i></span> great Authority among the</i> Moors, <i>in</i>
Banda, Amboyna, Ternate, <i>and</i> Tydore. <i>These Men urge their
Religion, and the Honour of</i> Mahomet, <i>and by that means manage
the People as they please; as I have found by Experience this Year, and
in this War we had at</i> Amboyna, <i>in which I was. For formerly
the</i> Moors <i>were soon weary of being at Sea, and when any Man of
Note happened to be kill&rsquo;d in Fight, they presently
retir&rsquo;d, looking upon it as an ill Omen. Now they continue all
the seasonable Months at sea, without flinching; tho&rsquo; the</i>
Portugueses <i>slew 150 of their Men, and among them their Admiral, and
others of the prime Commanders they had in their Fleet. To this must be
added, That this is a general Conspiracy of all the</i> Moors
<i>against us; insomuch, that two who were our Friends, and had
Assisted us several times, with their Fleets, against the</i> Ternates,
<i>being those of the Island</i> Burro, <i>these being summoned by the
Commander to Sail with him in the Navy, as they had done at other
times, did not only refuse it now, but would not so much as receive the
Message, or suffer him that carry&rsquo;d it to Land. The</i> Tydores
<i>did the same, for the Commander of</i> Amboyna <i>demanding
Assistance of them, they would not go, alledging that their Fort was in
as much Danger. And the King of</i> Tydore <i>being inform&rsquo;d of
your Lordships coming, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href=
"#pb128" name="pb128">128</a>]</span>his Subjects declare before hand,
and perhaps at the Instigation of their King, That they will have
no</i> Spaniards <i>in these Parts; which makes us look about, where
they will raise</i> Moors <i>to Destroy us. Therefore all Delays, in
this Affair, will be very dangerous; because we are Inferior to the</i>
Moors, <i>and must of Necessity Fight them, since it is for Religion,
and Honour, on both which Accounts they are become our mortal Enemies.
By this your <span class="marginnote">F. Marta <i>presses for
Relief</i>.</span> Lordship will understand what need we are in of your
Succour and Relief; and may compute how many are to draw their Swords
against you, since they are all our Enemies in general, and have
Conspir&rsquo;d against us. However, it will be Discretion first to
Dissemble with the</i> Tydores, <i>that they may not joyn the</i>
Ternates, <i>and by that means render the War more tedious and
difficult. I do not speak to all the rest in particular, according to
my Notion, because I refer it to</i> Jerome de Azevedo, <i>who will
give a very good Account. But let this be Established as a Maxim, That
your Lordship has a mighty Enterprize in Hand; and I trust in God he
will give you Wisdom, and Strength to go through it with Ease; since
you come to Revenge the Injuries formerly, and now offered by these
Barbarians, to God and his</i> <span class="marginnote">Irreverences to

drink out of the consecrated Chalices, and make use of the Patens to
Offer, or Receive any thing, as on profane Salvers; and of the
Vestments, and Ornaments of Altars, they make Cloaths, and Hangings for
their Houses. The People of</i> Banda, <i>most of them, wear Ornaments
of the Blood of above 3000 Christians, they Treacherously
Murder&rsquo;d, at several times, in their Ports, as they went thither
to Trade with them; and in that Island, and part of the Sea, there are
Streams of</i> Spanish <i>and</i> Portuguese <i>Blood running. Your
Lordship came to spread the Catholick Faith, and that you may the
better conceive what</i> Jerome de Azevedo <i>will say to you touching
this Affair, I send you by him a Draught of all this</i> Archipelago,
<i>as well of the</i> Moluccos, <i>as of</i> Amboyna, <i>and</i> Banda.
<i>In it your Lordship will see what a large Kingdom we loose, when it
might be recover&rsquo;d with little Cost. It only remains, That your
Lordship come, with all possible Expedition, because the greatest
Danger is in Delay; and when you are here you will find brave
Commanders, who will assist you with their</i> <span class=

will also find brave Soldiers, and there will not want to Pay them, for

<p>The Governour receiv&rsquo;d this Letter; which, with the Discourse
he had more at large with <i>Jerome de Azevedo</i>, made him put the
last Hand to a Work of so much Importance to the Service of the
Christian Commonwealth, which had been neglected in those Parts.
<i>Gaspar Gomez</i> had conferr&rsquo;d with him long before, and by
his Means, and the Accounts of other knowing Persons, the Governor was
so well acquainted with the Kingdoms, and Seas, the Seasons and Dangers
of the Undertaking, that he had no great need of <i>F. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name=
"pb129">129</a>]</span>Marta</i>&rsquo;s Map. He dispatch&rsquo;d
<i>Gaspar Gomez</i>, a Man of Secrecy and Activity, trusting him with
the Design, because he was recommended by several grave Fathers of that
Order. He gave him particular Instructions, with which, <span class=
"marginnote">Gaspar Gomez <i>sent as a Spy</i>.</span> and his own
Experience, he wander&rsquo;d about the <i>Archipelago</i>, and learnt
as much as was convenient. He visited <i>Ternate</i>, <i>Tydore</i>,
<i>Mindanao</i>, both the <i>Javas</i>, and scarce omitted any Place,
as far as the Point of <i>Malaca</i>, but what he took a View of.</p>
<p>In the Year 1593, King <i>Philip</i> the 2d bestow&rsquo;d the
Government of <i>Cartagena</i>, in <i>America</i>, upon <i>Don Pedro
Bravo de Acunna</i>. To take this Employ, <span class="marginnote">D.
Pedro de Acuna <i>Governor of</i> Cartagena.</span> he quitted that he
had in the <i>Spanish</i> Galleys; he was Captain of the Admiral
Galley, and Vice-Admiral of them all, under the <i>Adelantado</i>, or
Lord Lieutenant of <i>Castile</i>, his Kinsman. He had serv&rsquo;d his
Majesty many Years by Sea and Land, in the <i>Mediterranean</i>. No
Action of Note was perform&rsquo;d without him, since the Expedition of
<i>Navarino</i> against the <i>Turks</i>, and the <span class=
"marginnote"><i>His brave Actions.</i></span> others that ensu&rsquo;d
in those Parts, in <i>Naples</i>, in <i>Portugal</i>, and all those
that occur&rsquo;d before, till his Majesty was put in Possession of
that Crown. Lastly, When he commanded the <i>Spanish</i> Galleys he
fought those of the <i>Moors</i> and <i>Turks</i>, with the Galiots,
and Brigantines of the <i>Levant</i>, and <i>English</i> Ships, and
took and sunk several of both Sorts. He took a great Number of Slaves
in <i>Barbary</i>; particularly at <i>Zangazon</i>, <i>Benegicar</i>,
and <i>Alcazar</i>. He defended <i>Cadiz</i> from the Invasion, and
Rapine of <i>Drake</i>, the <i>English</i> Admiral, who attempted it
with a mighty Fleet. This was done by only four Galleys, but two of
which were clean, yet the Bravery of the Commander made amends for all.
How great an Action this was, and what Reputation <i>Don Pedro</i>
gain&rsquo;d by it, appear&rsquo;d afterwards, when the <i>English</i>
again possess&rsquo;d themselves of <i>Cadiz</i>, at the Time that all
the Galleys in <i>Spain</i> were in the Bay, and the Fleet then
preparing to sail to the <i>Indies</i>. In each of these Actions, most
whereof were victorious, there are many remarkable Particulars, and
they all deserve large Encomiums; but since they do not belong to the
Subject of this History, it would be blameable to insert them here.</p>
<p>The King for these Reasons constituted <i>Don Pedro de Acunna</i>,
his Captain General, in the Province of <i>Cartagena</i> and <i>Tierra
Firme</i>, and Commander of the Galleys on that Coast; which
Commissions had never before been united in that Government. He gave
him a Galley, and Orders to receive the Royal Fifths of the
Pearl-Fishery, at the Island <i>Margarita</i>. He set out from the Port
of <i>Sanlucar</i>, on the 27th of <i>September</i>, in a Pink, with 12
Soldiers, <span class="marginnote"><i>His Voyage.</i></span> some
Religious Men, and his Servants, the Galley, and another Ship
following. The Winds soon rose, and the Sea swell&rsquo;d, and the
Vessels were dispers&rsquo;d. In one of them there were 20 Soldiers,
and 40 Slaves at the Oar, this was so far drove away, that they saw it
no more, till five Days after they came to <i>Cartagena</i>. The Storm
ceas&rsquo;d, and <i>Don Pedro</i> arriv&rsquo;d at <i>Gran
Canaria</i>, but would not go into the City. He took in two hundred
Cask of Water. The Governour <i>Don Lewis de la Cueva</i> was not in
the Island; but it being known in his Family that <i>Don Pedro</i> was
come, they sent to welcome him. The Visit was follow&rsquo;d by some
Horses loaded with Abundance of Fowl, Game, Sheep, Wine, Pears, and
most stately Quinces, besides Abundance of other Provisions. He
sail&rsquo;d thence with a favourable Wind, which soon turn&rsquo;d
against him, and tho&rsquo; he was <span class="corr" id="xd21e15111"
title="Source: ar">far</span> enough off, drove back the Ships in Sight
of <i>Teneriffe</i>. After being toss&rsquo;d about for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span>some
Days, there happened such a tedious Calm between two Islands, as made
Amends for the Violence of the Storms, and yet he had others afterwards
as violent as those before. Many Days after, when they had lost their
reckning, they arriv&rsquo;d at the Island <i>Metalinon</i>, inhabited
by unconquered <i>Indians</i>, where they took in Water without
Opposition, for the Rest of the Voyage. Thence he had fair Weather to
the Island <i>Margarita</i>. As soon as he landed in the Harbour,
<i>Don John Sarmiento de Villandrando</i>, the Governour of the Island
came to meet him, having hourly expected him, since he knew he was to
come. The rejoycing, and Entertainment was such as became Friends, and
Friends of that Quality.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>An</i> English <i>Ship near the
Island</i> Margarita<span class="corr" id="xd21e15140" title=
"Not in source">.</span></span> An <i>English</i> Ship of above four
hundred Tun Burthen, with thirty Pieces of Cannon of five thousand
Weight each, and Abundance of Men, had been 30 days in a Harbour but
two Leagues from the Island <i>Margarita</i>. <i>Don John Sarmiento</i>
telling <i>Don Pedro</i>, what Insolences that Ship committed, and how
much to his Disreputation she oppress&rsquo;d the Islanders under his
Government, desir&rsquo;d he might attack her with his Galley. <i>Don
Pedro</i> perswaded him to desist from that Enterprize, since it did
not belong to him, and it was an unpardonable Fault to attack her,
without an equal Force. <i>Don John</i> persisted so long, that he
carry&rsquo;d it against <i>Don Pedro</i>&rsquo;s Opinion. They made to
the Place where the Ship lay, passing by dangerous Rocks, and being
come in Sight of it, perceiv&rsquo;d it was stronger, and better
provided than they had been told. Our Men, in Order to fight,
turn&rsquo;d out all the Women, most of them Wives to those that came
in the Galleys. Twenty Soldiers came from the Island <i>Margarita</i>,
by their Governours Order, who being ship&rsquo;d they appear&rsquo;d
by Break of Day in Sight of the Enemy. The Wind then <span class=
"marginnote"><i>The Islanders oblige</i> Don Pedro <i>to Fight
her</i>.</span> blowing fresh <i>Don Pedro</i> advising with the
Natives of the Island <i>Margarita</i> and their Governour told them,
it was requisite to expect a Calm, in Order to take the Ship, since the
Galley could wait for it under Shelter, without any Danger. The
Islanders being provok&rsquo;d by the Dammage they had receiv&rsquo;d,
and to flatter <i>Don John Sarmiento</i>, answer&rsquo;d, That they had
two of the Prime Men of that Ship Prisoners in the City, by whose
Account they were inform&rsquo;d of the Distress she was in, and that
she must surrender, as soon as attack&rsquo;d. This Opinion being
bandy&rsquo;d about with Obstinacy, came to be Positiveness in Don
<i>John</i>. <i>Don Pedro</i> looking upon it as such, and concerned to
see his Friend engag&rsquo;d in such a Piece of Madness, with those
Hot, but unexperienc&rsquo;d Men, said to them, By my long Experience
in several Seas, I know it is the worst of Conduct to attack a Ship,
when she has the Wind; but let us fall on; that the People of the
Island <i>Margarita</i> may not have it to say that I deferr&rsquo;d
engaging out of Fear, and not out of Discretion. This said, he
order&rsquo;d his Galley to weigh Anchor. He arm&rsquo;d himself, and
<i>Don John</i>, and just as the Sun appear&rsquo;d they attack&rsquo;d
the Ship <span class="marginnote"><i>The Engagement.</i></span> with
Fury and Violence. The <i>English</i> were not backward; they speedily
cut the Cables of three Anchors they had out, and leaving them in the
Sea, set their Sails. The Wind was fair and soon fill&rsquo;d them. The
Men were brisk and ply&rsquo;d their Cannon without ceasing. Our Galley
did the same, and fir&rsquo;d five Shot, before it receiv&rsquo;d any
Harm. Then she ran her Beak against the Poop of the Ship, but could not
grapple, nor board. Some Men went down to the Boats which were
tow&rsquo;d by the Ship, and cut the Ropes. The Ship, and Galley fell a
firing again, without Intermission. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb131" href="#pb131" name="pb131">131</a>]</span><i>Don Pedro</i>
receiv&rsquo;d a Musquet Shot on his Target, which glancing off broke
in Pieces a Board of the Stern Lockers, and wounded those that were
next it. A Cannon Ball took of the Head of one of our Slaves, and
scatter&rsquo;d his Brains in <i>Don Pedro&rsquo;s</i> Face; but
another Ball touch&rsquo;d him nearer, when it threw <i>Don John
Sarmiento</i> into the Sea, who being sunk by the Weight of his Armour,
was never seen again. Fourteen Soldiers of the Island <i>Margarita</i>,
and nine Spaniards were kill&rsquo;d, and many wounded, of all whom
<i>Don Pedro</i> took Care, without neglecting the other Duties of a
Commander. Some Persons of Note were also kill&rsquo;d, as <i>Alonso de
Anduxar</i>, a Youth about twenty Years of Age, of the Order of Christ,
and <i>Antonio Santiso</i>, who had been a Captain in <i>Flanders</i>.
The Ship holding on her Course, made the best of the fair Wind, and was
seen to fly, as if she had been victorious; tho&rsquo; she threw many
dead Bodies over Board, in Sight of our Men. <i>Don Pedro</i>
return&rsquo;d to the Island <i>Margarita</i>, lamenting the Death of
his Friend, and his Wifes Widow-Hood, amidst the Tears of other Widows,
and Fathers left Childless. He comforted the afflicted the best he
could, received the King&rsquo;s Boxes of Peals, and went on much
griev&rsquo;d at the Event, and to see how little his Precaution had
avail&rsquo;d.</p>
<p><i>Don Pedro</i> had a prosperous Passage thence, to the Island
<i>Curazao</i>, to <i>Rio de la Hacha</i>, and so in Sight of
<i>Cartagena</i>. Being descry&rsquo;d from the City <span class=
"marginnote">Don Pedro <i>at</i> Cartagena.</span> the Galleys went out
to meet him, whose Musick and Guns, with those of the Fort made a
Mixture of Harmony and Noise. He enter&rsquo;d upon the Government and
immediately took a View of the Galleys, Warlike Prepations being of the
greatest Consequence in those Parts. He found them shatter&rsquo;d, and
almost gone to Ruin, refitted one, and furnish&rsquo;d another with
Slaves, and all other Necessaries. All things were before in such
Disorder, and Confusion, that it was hard to distinguish betwixt the
Galley Slaves and the Soldiers, the former going about as free, and gay
as the latter. He blam&rsquo;d this Liberty, and order&rsquo;d the
Heads and Beards of the Slaves to be shav&rsquo;d, and that they should
be chain&rsquo;d. Next he took in hand the Divisions, Manners, and
civil Government of the City, and there was soon a Reformation of
Abuses, and publick Crimes, all this he perform&rsquo;d by his Valour,
and Example. He also review&rsquo;d the Horse and Foot; repair&rsquo;d
the Fortifications; attended all Martial Affairs; had his Gates always
open to decide Controversies, without Distinction of Persons; and
tho&rsquo; he had here considerable Opportunities offer&rsquo;d him,
and much Matter to discover his Capacity, and the Greatness of his
Soul, yet he found in himself greater Hopes and Desires, above what was
present, and exciting him to advance farther, and to make known to the
World that generous Restlessness, which was afterwards serviceable to
the Church, by restoring its former Honour, in the remotest
Provinces.</p>

<i>Gomez Perez</i>, still carrying on his Preparations, conceal&rsquo;d
the Design, without sparing any charge for Shipping, Provisions, or
Men. Among other Necessaries, he built four choice Galleys and for the
manning of them, took a Method which was look&rsquo;d upon as severe.
He Order&rsquo;d, That as many <i>Indians</i> who were Slaves to other
<i>Indians</i> of Quality, as would serve to Man the Galleys, should be
bought up, and Paid for by the <i>Spaniards</i>, who were Proprietors,
out of their own Money; setting the Price of each Slave at two
<i>Taes</i> in Gold, each <span class="marginnote">Taes <i>of Gold
their Value</i>.</span> <i>Tae</i> being little above an Ounce, which
was the Price Slaves had in former Times been valu&rsquo;d at among
them. He promis&rsquo;d, that the Proprietors should afterwards be
Refunded what they laid out, from the Kings Revenue. Yet this did not
seem to mollify the Rigour of the Order; because he improperly
call&rsquo;d those <i>Indians</i> Slaves, for their Lords use and love
them like Children, set them at their own Tables, and Marry them to
their Daughters; besides that, Slaves then were worth more Money. The
Concern of those that were to be Sold, was attended by that of the
Proprietors, who were to <span class="marginnote"><i>Discontent in
the</i> Philippines.</span> contribute out of their Estates, to defray
Charges they look&rsquo;d upon as not very Necessary, and to Disgust
their Vassals, by taking them away forcibly, being never likely to
recover the Money they laid down, which they <span class=
"marginnote"><i>The Governors excuses.</i></span> were well
assur&rsquo;d of. The Governour gave out, That those Galleys were to
secure the Country, and defend it from the Danger that threatned;
because he knew the Emperor of <i>Japan</i> was coming to Invade it,
with a numerous Fleet; and that it could not be Defended without
Galleys, and therefore it was absolutely Necessary to Man them with
Slaves, since they had no others to Row. That these were not to be
Fetter&rsquo;d in the Galleys, nor Treated like Slaves, but so kindly
used, that they themselves should prefer their Entertainment, before
that of their Lords, whom they look&rsquo;d upon as Parents, or
Fathers-in-Law. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133"
name="pb133">133</a>]</span></p>
<p>These Allegations, and the absolute Necessity of defending
themselves, <span class="marginnote"><i>The Design against the</i>
Moluccos <i>takes Air.</i></span> silenc&rsquo;d both Parties; but
could not stop the Mouth of Fame, for it was already known, what
Engagements he made before he came from <i>Spain</i>, to the King, the
Ministers, the Kindred, and Fomenters of the Expedition of
<i>Ternate</i>, so that whatsoever he conceal&rsquo;d, was
divulg&rsquo;d by uncertain Authors. However some advis&rsquo;d him not
to rely on the <i>Chineses</i>, or <i>Sangleyes</i> for the Defence of
the <i>Philippines</i>; because no natural or civil Tye had ever
gain&rsquo;d, or attracted their Affection towards them. That he ought
to remember the fresh Instance of what they did, when his Predecessor
employ&rsquo;d them, and consequently should be watchful over them.
That he sending a Supply of Men, Ammunitions and Provisions to the Fort
and Town of <i>Cagayan</i>, which is on the Coast of that Island of
<i>Luzon</i>, 80 leagues from the City <i>Manila</i>, and there being
then no Ship to send it in, Necessity pressing, he thought he might
relieve that Want, by making use of one of the <i>Chinese</i> Ships
that were then at Anchor in the Harbour, and clear&rsquo;d in Order to
return to <i>China</i>. He commanded the <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Falshood of the</i> Chineses.</span> Supply to be put
aboard her, and the <i>Chineses</i> to carry, and in the Way, to land
it where he directed, since it was no let to their Voyage; promising to
requite and gratify them for that Service. They undertook it with
extraordinary Tokens of good Will; but their Artifice appear&rsquo;d by
the Event, and show&rsquo;d how Men that are upon the Watch, improve
Opportunities. The <i>Chineses</i> set sail, and the second Day after,
when the <i>Spaniards</i> were asleep, as believing themselves safe
among trusty Friends, they fell upon them so unexpectedly, that they
had not Time to stand upon their Guard, but were all murder&rsquo;d and
cast into the Sea. They plunder&rsquo;d all they carry&rsquo;d, and
dividing the Spoil, sail&rsquo;d for their own Country. They
<span class="marginnote">Spanish <i>Woman abandon&rsquo;d in</i>
China.</span> only sav&rsquo;d one unhappy <i>Spanish</i> Woman, that
went with our Men, and took her along with them. They spar&rsquo;d her
Life, but after having insolently abus&rsquo;d her, they set her
ashore, in a Sea-Port Town of the first Part of <i>China</i> they made.
She presently had Recourse to the Magistrates, whom she acquainted with
the Villany those Men had committed, and the Wrongs they had done her;
but tho&rsquo; favourably heard by those Judges, she had no
Satisfaction for her Wrongs, nor could she obtain Justice. However they
appointed Officers to carry her up the Country, remitting her to other
Supream Magistrates. In this Journey, which was many Leagues, she
endur&rsquo;d more than she had done before, till some of the Governors
taking Compassion on her and her Tears, carry&rsquo;d her to the City
of <i>Macao</i>, where the <i>Portugueses</i> reside, and set her at
Liberty. Thus the whole Matter came to be known, and it was at
<i>Manila</i> in the Mouths of all Men, who now magnify&rsquo;d it,
upon Occasion of the New Enterprize.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Chineses <i>put into the
Galleys.</i></span> In short, all the Slaves demanded by the Governour
<i>Gomez Perez</i>, were raised with much Trouble and Oppression, and
in the same Manner they were put into the Galleys, where they
continu&rsquo;d some Time before they departed, and many of them
dy&rsquo;d, as not being us&rsquo;d to that sort of Life. All those
Slaves were not sufficient to Man the Galleys, and the Admiral Galley
remain&rsquo;d without Rowers. This, and the Necessity of finishing the
Work produc&rsquo;d a more rigorous Practice than the former. The
Governour order&rsquo;d that 250 of the <i>Chineses</i>, who resort to
the <i>Philippines</i> to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href=
"#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span>Trade, should be taken to Man the
Admiral Galley, and each of them to be allow&rsquo;d two Pieces of
Eight a Month, out of the King&rsquo;s Revenue. He assur&rsquo;d them,
they should not be chain&rsquo;d, but at Liberty, and with their Arms,
to serve as Soldiers; and that they should only row in the Galleys when
there was any Calm, and to weather some Capes. The <i>Chineses</i>
being acquainted by their <i>Chinese</i> Governour with this
Resolution, positively refus&rsquo;d it, as an intolerable Burden. But
our Governour pressing to bring about his Design, the <i>Chinese</i>
assembled his People, to treat about the Affair, and contrive how 250
might be chosen out from among them all, threatning that he would take
every Tenth Man out of their Houses. These Words provok&rsquo;d them to
such a Degree, that the next Day they shut up the very Windows of their
Houses, and the Traders their Shops, and stopp&rsquo;d the Provisions
which run through their Hands. Our Governour seeing this Proceeding,
and alledging that they mutiny&rsquo;d, caus&rsquo;d about 50 of those
that came next to hand, to be seiz&rsquo;d, and put to the Oar in the
Galley. The others terrify&rsquo;d by this Action, met, and drew from
among them all, the 250, and because no Man would be of that Number,
they divided 20000 Pieces of Eight among those that would comply, and
gave every <i>Chinese</i> that would go in the Galley 80 Pieces of
Eight, besides the King&rsquo;s Pay. By Means of this good
Encouragement, there was no Want of <i>Chineses</i> that listed
themselves to row, but the 20000 Pieces of Eight were consum&rsquo;d
among them, or rather among the Officers. These 250 <i>Chineses</i>
were form&rsquo;d into five Companies, under five <i>Chinese</i>
Christian Captains, who pass&rsquo;d Musters and Reviews, with Pikes
and <i>Catanes</i>, which differ little from Cymiters, and
express&rsquo;d Joy and Satisfaction.</p>
<p>Whilst these Things were in Agitation, Brother <i>Gaspar Gomez</i>
came <span class="marginnote">B. Gaspar Gomez <i>brings
Intelligence.</i></span> to <i>Manila</i>, full of Intelligence,
whereof he gave the Governour an Account, at several private
Conferences. He said, the King of <i>Ternate</i>&rsquo;s Affairs were
in no ill Posture; tho&rsquo; somewhat weak&rsquo;ned, by not agreeing
with the Prime Men of his Kingdom; and that many of them threatned,
they would Rebel, on Account of his Tyranny, and because he
rais&rsquo;d intolerable Taxes. That then, neither the
<i>Javaneses</i>, nor the <i>Lascarines</i>, nor the <i>Moors</i> of
<i>Mecca</i> frequented <i>Ternate</i>, as they had done at the Time
when Captain <i>Morones</i> arriv&rsquo;d there, under the Government
of <i>Santiago de Vera</i>. He gave very particular Information
concerning the two Forts of <i>Talangame</i>. That the King of
<i>Ternate</i> had then about 3000 common <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Strength of</i> Ternate.</span> Soldiers, 1000
Musquetiers, and a great Number from his other Kingdoms. That they
fought with Darts, <i>Campilanes</i>, or Cymiters, and Shields; and
others had Coats of Mail, and Head-Pieces they got from the
<i>Portugueses</i>, in exchange for Spice. That they had Abundance of
Ammunition, all of their own making, of the Materials the
<i>Javaneses</i> brought to barter for Clove. That the Principal Place
was the City <i>Ternate</i>, where the King and all his Court reside,
and therefore it is best secur&rsquo;d, and from thence all others are
supply&rsquo;d, supported, and encourag&rsquo;d. <span class=
"marginnote"><i>How to be attack&rsquo;d.</i></span> He advis&rsquo;d
that our Men should assault it before Break of Day; because all Attacks
made upon those People in the Morning Watch had been successful. That,
if our Fleet came unexpected, it would certainly succeed; but that the
said King had his Spies spread abroad in almost all those Islands,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name=
"pb135">135</a>]</span>as far as those of <i>Canela</i>,
<i>Sarvangan</i> and <i>Mindanao</i>. That a good Number of Brass
Sakers, and other great Guns might be brought in the <i>Carcoas</i>,
from the Fort of <i>Amboyna</i>, and the Kings of <i>Sian</i>, and
<i>Tydore</i>. That the People of <i>Amboyna</i> would send them upon
Command, those of <i>Sian</i> and <i>Tydore</i>, upon very small
Intreaty; because besides their owning the Crown of <i>Spain</i>, they
are Enemies to <i>Ternate</i>. That the necessary Preparation for
finishing the War, even in case the King of <i>Tydore</i> should fail,
and it might be suspected he would not willingly see his Enemy utterly
destroy&rsquo;d, consisted in Artillery and Shipping, which was ready,
and above 1200 Soldiers well arm&rsquo;d, with their Coats of Mail and
Head-Pieces, till they went over to the Island of <i>Banda</i>, to put
in the necessary Garrison there. <span class="marginnote"><i>Light
Vessels of good Use.</i></span> That there should be a Number of Light
Vessels to take the Enemy flying; for by that Means the War would be
quite concluded in a short Time, and without Bloodshed. That even the
Malecontent <i>Ternates</i> declar&rsquo;d, and publish&rsquo;d as
much, and own&rsquo;d, that if a considerable Number of Fighting Men
should come into their Country, they would all come in and submit
without striking Stroke. Hence he inferr&rsquo;d, that there were
conceal&rsquo;d Christians in the <i>Molucco</i> Islands. That the
Conquest of the whole Island of <i>Banda</i>, was very advantageous and
profitable, and not hazardous, and that the Neighbourhood of
<i>Amboyna</i>, which was ours, would be of great Consequence for
maintaining it. He further affirm&rsquo;d, That the <i>Portugueses</i>
very much facilitated the Enterprize, and magnify&rsquo;d the great
Benefit it would be to his Majesty; and that <i>F. Antony Marta</i>, of
whom the Governour had so great a Conceit, was of the same Opinion.
Brother <i>Gaspar Gomez</i> added so many Circumstances to these
particular Accounts, that he wholly inflam&rsquo;d the
Governour&rsquo;s Heart.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>King of</i> Camboxa <i>sends</i>
Spaniards <i>Embassadors to the Governour.</i></span> At this Time,
<i>Landara</i>, King of <i>Camboxa</i>, sent the Governour an Embassy
by two <i>Spanish</i> Commanders, attended by many of his Subjects,
with such Splendor as the Occasion of it requir&rsquo;d. That barbarous
King thought fit his Embassadors should not be natural born Subjects,
because of the Occasion his People had given him to suspect their
Fidelity. He chose them of Different Conditions, to the End that such
Variety, the Diversity of Inclinations, and Opposition, might produce
the better Effect. The one of them was a <i>Portuguese</i>, his Name
<i>James Veloso</i>, the other a <i>Spaniard</i>, <i>Blas Ruyz de
Fernan Gonzalez</i>. They brought <i>Gomez Perez</i> a Magnificent
<span class="marginnote"><i>Their Present.</i></span> Present, a great
Quantity of <i>Ivory</i>, <i>Benjamin</i>, <i>China</i> Ware, Pieces of
Silk and Cotton, and an <i>Elephant</i> of a generous Temper, as
afterwards appear&rsquo;d by Experience. They deliver&rsquo;d their
Embassy, the Purport <span class="marginnote"><i>Subject of their
Embassy.</i></span> whereof was, to desire Succour against the King of
<i>Sian</i>, who was marching against him of <i>Camboxa</i>, with a
numerous Army; offering in Return for his Assistance to become subject
to <i>Spain</i>, and embrace Christianity. That the King concluded,
that so brave and gallant a Gentleman as <i>Gomez Perez</i>, would not
on Account of any other Diversion refuse to perform an Action, which
must redound so much to the Glory of God, and the Advantage of the
Crown of <i>Spain</i>. The Governour receiv&rsquo;d the Present, making
a Return with another of some <i>European</i> Curiosities; and by way
<span class="marginnote"><i>The Answer.</i></span> of Answer,
thank&rsquo;d that King for the Confidence he had seem&rsquo;d to place
in him; but that, for the Present, he could not possibly afford the
Succours, nor divert those Forces, which he was getting ready, to
punish the King <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136"
name="pb136">136</a>]</span>of <i>Ternate</i>, and recover that
Kingdom, and the rest of the <i>Moluccos</i>, which had Rebell&rsquo;d,
so much to the Dishonour of the <i>Spanish</i> Nation. That his
Highness should place his Confidence in the Goodness of God, and
persevere in the Design of serving him in his Holy and True Religion,
and as soon as the Expedition of <i>Ternate</i> was over, he would
convert his Forces to the Relief of <i>Camboxa</i>. The Embassadors
were dismiss&rsquo;d with these Hopes, which the Governours Son, <i>Don
Lewis de las Marinas</i>, afterwards made good; and to give them entire
Satisfaction, and justify the Delay, it was found necessary to make
Publick the true Design of that Fleet, which till then had been kept
secret.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Mighty Preparations against</i>
Ternate.</span> The Governour, in fine, resolv&rsquo;d to set forward,
and endeavour&rsquo;d to take along with him all the Men he could get.
All were listed that could be prevail&rsquo;d upon either by Force or
Intreaties. The Proprietors and Soldiers were extravagantly expensive,
upon the Ships, Provisions, and Gallantry; and the <i>Philipines</i>
being well furnish&rsquo;d with all Things, they did more than had been
imagin&rsquo;d, or could be in the Governour&rsquo;s Power. He sent his
Son <i>Don Lewis</i>, with all the Soldiers that were in Pay, to the
Island of <i>Zebu</i>, where the Fleet was to rendevous, and there he
continued six Months, waiting for new Orders. <i>Gomez Perez</i>
stay&rsquo;d at <i>Manila</i>, ordering Matters of great Moment. Two
Days before his Departure, being invited by, and supping in the House
of <i>Peter de Rojas</i>, his Lieutenant, where diverting himself with
Gaming, and much Pleasure, he grew <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Prediction of ill Success.</i></span> so merry,
contrary to his Custom, and the Harshness of his Temper, that many
interpreted it as a good Omen of his Success. He said in Discourse,
that <i>F. Vincent</i>, of the Order of <i>St. Francis</i>, had told
him, the Enterprize could not succeed, because the Army was made up of
Men that were carry&rsquo;d away by Force, and particularly the
marry&rsquo;d Men were so. He departed <i>Manila</i> on the 17th of
<i>October</i>, with six Royal Galleys, one Galleon, one small Vessel
call&rsquo;d a <i>Foist</i>, one little Frigot, and several other
Frigots, Carcoas, and Bireyes, which are another Sort of <span class=
"marginnote"><i>The Fleet sets out.</i></span> Vessels of the Natives;
all which, being part the Kings, and part belonging to Subjects, who
offer&rsquo;d to serve him with their Lives and Fortunes, amounted to
an hundred. There were a Thousand <i>Spaniards</i> well arm&rsquo;d;
above four hundred Musquetiers of the Territory of <i>Manila</i>; a
thousand more of those they call <i>Visaias</i>, Men arm&rsquo;d with
Lances, Shields, <span class="marginnote"><i>Its Force.</i></span> Bows
and Arrows, and above four hundred <i>Chineses</i>, of those that dwelt
in the Island, besides a good Number of those that came to Trade taken
into Pay; but many more Compell&rsquo;d than Voluntiers. The Galleys
carry&rsquo;d Abundance of Provisions for the Army, over which he
appointed his Son <i>Don Lewis Perez</i>, his Lieutenant, and sent him
before, as has been said, with Orders to make for the Island of
<i>Zebu</i>. He embark&rsquo;d himself aboard the Admiral-Galley, which
had twenty eight Benches for the Men to row, and was mann&rsquo;d with
the 250 <i>Chineses</i> for the Oar. Eighty <i>Spaniards</i> were put
aboard it; they touch&rsquo;d at <i>Cabite</i>, sail&rsquo;d thence on
the 19th, and with them some Vessels, in which there were private
Persons, who follow&rsquo;d at their own Expence, coasting the Island
of <i>Manila</i> as far as <i>Balajan</i>. They parted, because the
Vessels kept in Sight of Land, and the Governour put out to Sea. On the
25th he came alone to pass the Night, at the Point call&rsquo;d <i>de
Azufre</i>, or of Brimstone, in the Island of <i>Manila</i>,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name=
"pb137">137</a>]</span>opposite to that of <i>Caza</i>, where the
Current, and the Drift of the Water from the Land run strong, and the
Breezes then blowing, the Galley could not weather it. He
anchor&rsquo;d under the Shelter of it, and yet dragg&rsquo;d a little
with the Force of the Current. They made the <i>Chineses</i> row
excessive <span class="marginnote">Chineses <i>at the Oars ill
us&rsquo;d.</i></span> hard, to bring her up again under the Land. In
short, they row&rsquo;d very faintly, either because they were not
us&rsquo;d to that Labour, and forc&rsquo;d to the Oar, or because they
were then tir&rsquo;d, and incens&rsquo;d with the Command. Other
contrary Winds darted up, which again obstructed their Voyage, and to
weather some Points of Land, it was necessary to ply the Oars, and to
vex the Crew, with the usual Severity and Punishment commonly inflicted
aboard the Galleys. They thought this hard, and contrary to what the
Governour had assur&rsquo;d them, which was, that they should be kindly
treated; but neither the Lash, nor the Threats, nor the stemming of the
Currents, with the Vigour and Sweat of their Bodies, seem&rsquo;d so
<span class="marginnote"><i>The Governour threatens them.</i></span>
intollerable, and injurious to them, as to hear the angry and stern
Governour himself bid them row manfully, for if they did not, he would
put them in Chains, and cut off their Hair. This to the <i>Chineses</i>
is an Affront that deserves Death, for they place their Honour in their
Hair, which they cherish and preserve very fair, and value themselves
upon it, as the Ladies in <i>Europe</i> us&rsquo;d to do, all their
Delight and Reputation being <span class="marginnote"><i>The</i>
Chineses <i>rebel and kill the</i> Spaniards.</span> in keeping it
curiously comb&rsquo;d. Hereupon they resolv&rsquo;d to mutiny, to
prevent such an Affront and Contempt. The next Night, which was the
25th of <i>October</i>, being appointed for the Execution, when the
tir&rsquo;d <i>Spaniards</i> laid themselves down upon the Benches, and
other convenient Places in the Vessel, the <i>Chineses</i> did so too,
but cunningly dividing themselves, every one lay down by a
<i>Spaniard</i>, pretending to be asleep. In the dead of the last
Watch, which they thought the properest and safest Time, seeing the
<i>Spaniards</i> sound asleep, the <i>Chineses</i>, upon hearing of a
shrill Whistle, which was the Signal agreed upon between them, started
up all together, and every Man with wonderful Celerity put on a white
Vest, or Shirt, that they might know one another in the Height of their
Fury, and the Darkness of the Night, and so distinguish where to make
the Slaughter, tho&rsquo; for the more Security, they also lighted
abundance of Wax-Candles, which they had conceal&rsquo;d wrap&rsquo;d
up in those white Vests. Then they drew their <i>Catanas</i>, which are
keener, and more crooked than our <i>Cymiters</i>, and began without
any Noise every Man to hew his next <i>Spaniard</i>; so proceeding in
their Fury, and killing all those that slept. Above 60 Persons had
imbark&rsquo;d in the Admiral-Galley, some of them being the
Governour&rsquo;s Servants, and other old Soldiers, who suffer&rsquo;d
Inconveniencies to oblige and divert him. They had play&rsquo;d all the
Night, and being tir&rsquo;d, and the Heat very violent, they lay
naked, some on the Gang-Way in the middle of the Galley, others on the
Benches, and the greatest Favourites, who had more Room allow&rsquo;d
them, in the Poop, and to that Purpose the Governour retired into the
Cabin. The <i>Chineses</i> continu&rsquo;d the Execution, on those who
slept, without any Mistrust, which was done so expeditiously, that when
some of those who slept in the Poop awak&rsquo;d, the other
<i>Spaniards</i> were all kill&rsquo;d. The Watch heard nothing of it,
tho&rsquo; <span class="corr" id="xd21e15864" title=
"Source: their">there</span> could be no Excuse for that Neglect,
because there had been Instances and Warnings enough before. Others
awak&rsquo;d, and feeling themselves <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb138" href="#pb138" name="pb138">138</a>]</span>wounded, in the
Confusion leap&rsquo;d into the Sea, where most of them <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Many of them drowned. Only 12 escape.</i></span> were
drown&rsquo;d; some few cast themselves into the Sea before they were
hurt, and were also swallow&rsquo;d up by it, tho&rsquo; they were near
Land, because the Current being strong, they could not stem it; twelve
escap&rsquo;d, and many Bodies were found along the Shores.</p>
<p>The <i>Chineses</i> now grown bold, drew out the Pikes they had hid
under the Benches, and finish&rsquo;d their Treacherous Work with
Noise. The Governor, <span class="marginnote"><i>The Governor
kill&rsquo;d.</i></span> who was under Deck, Sleeping, with a Candle
and Lanthorn by him, Awak&rsquo;d; and that he might do so, they made
the greater Noise; and the <i>Chineses</i> themselves cry&rsquo;d out
to him, desiring he would come up to pacify a Quarrel there was among
the <i>Castillas</i>, so they call the <i>Spaniards</i>. He, for this
Reason, or believing the Galley dragg&rsquo;d, as it had done at other
times, getting up in his Shirt, and opening the Scuttle, look&rsquo;d
out, lifting half his Body above it: At the same time the
<i>Chineses</i> fell upon him with their Cymiters, and wounded him
Mortally, clutting his Head, and running him through with their Pikes
in more than barbarous manner. Seeing his Death near he drew back, and
took up the Prayer Book of his Order, which he always carry&rsquo;d
about him, and an Image of our Blessed Lady, and ended his life between
those two Advocates, which were afterwards seen bathed in his Blood:
Yet he dy&rsquo;d not presently, for they afterwards found him in his
Bed, imbracing the Image, where he Bled to Death, and about him the
Bodies of <i>Daniel Gomez de Leon</i>, his Valet de Chamber,
<i>Pantaleon de Brito</i>, <i>Sucro Diaz</i>, <i>John de Chavez</i>,
<i>Peter Maseda</i>, <i>John de S. Juan</i>, <i>Carrion Ponce</i>, and
<i>Francis Castillo</i>, all of them his Servants, and four brave
Slaves, who had the same End. This was not known till it was Day;
because none of the <i>Chineses</i> durst go down where the Governor
was that Night, fearing least some of the 80 <i>Spaniards</i> that were
in the Galley, had retir&rsquo;d thither; such was the Dread of their
own Guilt. None were left <span class="marginnote"><i>Two sav&rsquo;d
alive.</i></span> alive in the Galley, but <i>F. Francis Montilla</i>,
of the Barefoot Order of <i>S. Francis</i>, and <i>John de Cuellar</i>,
the Governors Secretary, who lay under Deck, whether the fainthearted
<i>Chineses</i> durst not go down in three Days, when their first Fury
was over. Then they afterwards set Ashore, on the Coast of
<i>Ilocos</i>, in the same Island of <i>Luzon</i>, that the Natives
might suffer them to Water; and because the Frier and the Secretary had
Capitulated, having their promise that they would do them no hurt,
before they surrendered. The <i>Chineses</i> being satisfy&rsquo;d that
there were no more ancient Christians left, began to Shout and Roar for
Joy that they had gone through with their Work, and had no Man more to
stand in Awe of.</p>
<p>The <i>Spaniards</i>, who were in the other Vessels, near the Shore,
tho&rsquo; they saw the Lights, and heard a confus&rsquo;d Noise aboard
the Admiral, thought it might be on account of some Work belonging to
the Galley, or the like. <span class="marginnote"><i>The</i> Chineses
<i>sail for</i> China.</span> When, a long time after, they understood
how matters went, from those who sav&rsquo;d themselves by Swimming,
they lay still, not being able to redress it. They were but few; had
not Strength enough; and the Mischief was done. They stay&rsquo;d till
Morning, and when Day appear&rsquo;d, perceiv&rsquo;d that the Galley
had set her Shoulder-of-Mutton-Sail, and was standing for <i>China</i>,
but they could not follow her; The Wind favouring, she sail&rsquo;d all
along the Coast of the Island, till they got clear of it, the
<i>Chineses</i> all the way Celebrating their Victory. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name="pb139">139</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The two Prisoners beg an easy Death, and
are promis&rsquo;d their Lives.</i></span> The Frier and the Secretary,
who were among them, being fully perswaded they would soon kill them,
and fearing it would be after some of their cruel Methods, holding up
their Hands, begg&rsquo;d they would allow them some Time to make their
Peace with God; and in case they would put them to Death, that it might
be by Beheading, and not any other Inhuman Way. One of the
<i>Chineses</i> bid them not Fear, for they should not Dye. They all
lay&rsquo;d down their bloody Weapons, and prostrating themselves,
return&rsquo;d Thanks to Heaven in most humble manner, beating Drums,
and ringing Bells they carry&rsquo;d, according to their Custom. The
two Christians being then bolted to a Bench in the Galley, during 15
Days their Captivity lasted, were fed with a small Proportion of Rice,
boil&rsquo;d in Water, without Salt, continually looking upon the Blood
of their Companions that had been spilt, wherewith all the Deck was
Stain&rsquo;d. They shed Abundance of Tears on it, besides those they
hourly let fall with the Apprehension of Death, those <i>Chineses</i>,
like faithless false Men, designing to take away their Lives, in some
strange manner. They weigh&rsquo;d, and sailed between the Islands of
<i>Mindanao</i> and <i>Luban</i>, towards <i>China</i>, and Coasting
along <i>Manila</i> towards <i>Cagayan</i>, some contrary Winds
happening to blow, and Calms succeeding, they were much
concern&rsquo;d, fearing, that if the News of <span class=
"marginnote"><i>The</i> Chineses <i>invoke their Gods.</i></span> their
Treachery reach&rsquo;d the <i>Philippines</i>, they would send after
and overtake them. This Dread made them have recourse to their Gods,
and call upon them, offering several sorts of Sacrifices, Perfumes, and
Prayers, which the Devil often answer&rsquo;d in formal Words, by the
Mouths of such as were Possessed, whom he Enter&rsquo;d to that
Purpose, for there never wanted two or three such, all the time those
Christians were in the Galley. What they saw was, that when least they
thought of it, and on a sudden, the Person possessed began to quake,
from Head to Foot. The others seeing him in that Condition, said,
<i>Some God was coming to Speak to them</i>. Then coming up
<span class="marginnote"><i>Some of them possess&rsquo;d.</i></span> to
him, with Tokens of Respect, they unty&rsquo;d, and spread abroad his
Hair; and stripping him quite naked set him on his Feet, and he
presently fell a Dancing to the Noise of some Drum, or Bell, they beat
or rung. They put a Cymiter, or Spear into his Hand, and as he
danc&rsquo;d he brandish&rsquo;d it over all their Heads, with no small
danger of hurting them, which they were not the least <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e16019" title=
"Source: apprenhensive">apprehensive</span> of; alledging, that their
God, tho&rsquo; he did so, would never hurt them, without they were
guilty of some Sin against him.</p>
<p>Before the Devil had possess&rsquo;d any in the Galley, the
<i>Chineses</i> were concerting <span class="marginnote"><i>Christians
preserv&rsquo;d by Means of the Devil.</i></span> to murder the
Christians, believing they were the Occasion, why God did not give them
a fair Wind for their Voyage; but that watchful sovereign Providence,
without whose Direction the least Accident does not happen, making Use
of the Devil himself as an Instrument, prevented it by Means of those
very Persons who offended it. The Person possess&rsquo;d ask&rsquo;d
for Ink and Paper, which being presently brought him, he made certain
Characters and confus&rsquo;d Scrawls, which being expounded by the
others in the Galley, they found signify&rsquo;d, that those two Men
were harmless, therefore they should not kill them, which was no small
Incouragement to the Prisoners. However this lasted not long, for some
others who were possess&rsquo;d after the first, tormented them
cruelly, especially one of them, who was the maddest. He told the
<i>Chineses</i>, that if he should happen to hurt those Men, as he
brandish&rsquo;d the Weapon he had in his Hand over <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span>them, making Essays, as if he cut and
slash&rsquo;d, then they must kill them immediately; because it would
be a certain Sign, that their Gods requir&rsquo;d it, and that their
being in the Ship was the Occasion, why they gave them not a fair Gale.
All the Men in the Galley assembled, to behold that Spectacle, and the
Person possess&rsquo;d having for a considerable Space walk&rsquo;d
about the Gang-Way, with extravagant Gestures, went then to the Place
where the Religious Man and his Companion were; there growing hellishly
inrag&rsquo;d, he commanded all the rest to stand aside, and being left
with only the two Prisoners, began to make hideous Faces and Grimaces
at them, <span class="marginnote"><i>Horred practices upon the
Prisoners.</i></span> when getting upon the Table in the mid Part of
the Galley, he thence threw his Cymiter at them, with such Fury, that
it stuck in the Deck, between their Feet. Seeing he had not hurt nor
touch&rsquo;d them, he ask&rsquo;d for it again to make a second and
third Tryal, sticking it every Time so deep, that the others could
scarce draw it out from the Planks. This done, he bid them give him a
Partesan, with which he hack&rsquo;d, hew&rsquo;d, and thurst, in such
frightful and dangerous Manner, that the <i>Chineses</i> themselves
were astonish&rsquo;d. He kept them above an hour in that Dread and
Affliction, without daring to stir, or beg for Mercy; believing it
would not avail them, but that on the contrary, whatsoever they could
say might be prejudicial. Thus having plac&rsquo;d all their Hopes, and
Confidence on that sovereign Lord, who even when he delays does not
fail to give Assistance, they call&rsquo;d upon him, and offer&rsquo;d
themselves up to him in fervent Prayers; particularly the Religious
Man, repeating some Psalms and Verses, which his former Devotion,
excited by the present Danger, brought into his Mind, and were suitable
to that Occasion, and such like Exigencies; by which, as he afterwards
said, he receiv&rsquo;d great Comfort, and Addition of Courage. This
sort of miserable Life, and these Torments lasted all or most Days
during therein Captivity.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The</i> Chineses <i>land, 820 of them
are kill&rsquo;d.</i></span> At length, the <i>Chineses</i> perceiving
they could not possibly perform the Voyage they desir&rsquo;d, by
Reason the Wind was contrary; they resolv&rsquo;d to land on the Island
of <i>Ilocos</i>, not far from <i>Luzon</i>, at the Port they call
<i>Sinay</i>. They being there ashore to Water, the Natives knowing
they had murder&rsquo;d the Governour, laid an Ambush and kill&rsquo;d
twenty of them, and might have destroyed above eighty that had landed,
if they had not wanted Courage; because at the very Shout the Men gave,
when falling on, they were so daunted, that they all fled several Ways
in Confusion, throwing down their Arms, endeavouring to save their
Lives, by leaping into the Sea, so to get off in the Boat. The
<i>Chineses</i> meeting with this Disaster, and thinking one of their
own Men had been the Occasion of it, because he advised them to put
into that Port, they resolv&rsquo;d to seize and put him <span class=
"marginnote"><i>They drown one of their own Men.</i></span> to Death.
They did as had been resolv&rsquo;d, and at Night, by unanimous
Consent, threw him into the Sea, then weighing their Anchors, they got
out of that Harbour, and put into another, three Leagues off, on the
same Coast. There the Devil entering into one of them, as he us&rsquo;d
to do, commanded them immediately to return to the Port, where they had
sustain&rsquo;d that Loss of their Friends and Companions, and that
they should not depart thence, till they had sacrific&rsquo;d a Man to
him, without appointing which he would have. They immediately
obey&rsquo;d the Command, one of the Chief <i>Chineses</i> making
Choice of one of the Christian <i>Indians</i> of the <i>Philippines</i>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span>they had Prisoners, to be Sacrifiz&rsquo;d, and
ty&rsquo;d his Hands and Feet, stretching them on a Cross, which they
rais&rsquo;d up, and the Christian being bound against the fore-Mast,
one of those possess&rsquo;d by the Devil came up <span class=
"marginnote"><i>An</i> Indian <i>cruelly Sacrifiz&rsquo;d.</i></span>
to him in Sight of them all, and playing the part of an Executioner,
ripp&rsquo;d up his Breast, with one of those Daggers they use, making
a wound so large, that he thrust in his Hand with ease, and
pluck&rsquo;d out part of his Entrals, whereof, with horrid Fury, he
bit a Mouthful, and casting the rest up into the Air, eat what he had
in his Mouth, and lick&rsquo;d his Hands, pleasing himself with the
Blood that stuck to them.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>They cast him into the Sea.</i></span>
Having committed the Murder, they took the Cross, and him that was on
it, and cast it and the Martyr into the Sea, which receiv&rsquo;d that
Body, offer&rsquo;d in Sacrifize to the Devil, then to be
cloath&rsquo;d in Glory, by him that has provided it for those who
suffer for the Confession of the Faith. This dreadful Spectacle struck
Horror, and rais&rsquo;d Emulation in the two Christians, who beheld it
with Zeal, and had expected as much before. The Inhuman Sacrifice being
over, they put out of the Harbour, and having for some days Coasted the
Island with Difficulty; one of them, by command of the Possess&rsquo;d
Person, who had order&rsquo;d the Sacrifice, with the consent
<span class="marginnote"><i>The Secretary and Frier set at
Liberty.</i></span> of them all, set at liberty the Religious Man, the
Secretary, and all the <i>Indians</i> they had Prisoners, putting them
ashore in the Boat, and then the <i>Chineses</i> stood out to Sea. They
endeavour&rsquo;d to make over to <i>China</i>, but not being able, put
into <i>Cochinchina</i>, where the King of <i>Tunquin</i> took all they
had, and among the rest two heavy Pieces of Cannon, that had been put
aboard for the Expedition of the <i>Moluccos</i>, the King&rsquo;s
Standard, and all the Jewels, Goods, and Money. He suffer&rsquo;d the
Galley to perish on the Coast, and the <i>Chineses</i> dispers&rsquo;d,
flying into several Provinces. Others affirm, that King seiz&rsquo;d
and punish&rsquo;d them.</p>

who hated the Governour for his Severity, rejoyced; but that ill Will
soon vanish&rsquo;d, and all generally lamented him; more especially
when some of the Bodies were found and brought in. Among them were
those of the Ensign, <i>John Diaz Guerrero</i>, an old Soldier, and

<p><span class="marginnote">Rojas <i>chose Governour by the

Order so to do, believing it might be lost in the Galley, among much of
the Kings, his own, and private Persons Goods, the City therefore chose
the Licentiate <i>Rojas</i> for their Governour, and he was so forty
Days. But the Secretary <i>John de Cuellar</i> returning to
<i>Manila</i>, in a miserable Condition, with <i>F. Francis de
Montilla</i>, gave Notice, that <i>Gomez Perez</i>, before his
Departure had appointed his Son <i>Don Lewis</i> to succeed, and that
this would be found at the Monastery of <i>S. Augustin</i>, in a Box,

for all the People employ&rsquo;d in the Expedition, to return, as was
accordingly done. So that <i>Don Lewis</i> coming, not withstanding
some Protestations, he, by Virtue of his Father&rsquo;s Authority,
succeeded him in the Government, till <i>Don Francis Tello</i>
came.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Character of</i> Gomez Perez.</span>
Such was the End of that Gentleman, whose Actions were valuable in
themselves, and the more for the Zeal he did them with. He wanted not
for political and martial Virtues, nor for Prudence in both Sorts; but
he would not regard Examples; and contrary to what those taught him,
durst promise himself to succeed, so that he became confident, if not
rash. But his Christian Piety makes Amends for all.</p>
<p><i>Don Lewis</i>, his Kindred and Friends, would fain have
prosecuted the Expedition <span class="marginnote"><i>The Fleet

<i>F. Antony Fernandez</i> came from <i>Tydore</i>; but he succeeded
not. The Fleet was dismiss&rsquo;d, and it was a singular Providence
for the Security of the <i>Philippine</i> Islands; for presently after,
at the Beginning of the Year 1594, there came thither a great Number of
Ships from <i>China</i>, loaded only with Men and Arms, and
<span class="corr" id="xd21e16277" title=
"Source: brining">bringing</span> no Merchandize, as they are wont to
do. Those Ships brought seven <i>Mandarines</i>, being some of the
chief Viceroys and Governours of the Provinces. It was believ&rsquo;d,
and <span class="marginnote"><i>Arm&rsquo;d</i> Chineses <i>in the</i>
Philippines.</span> prov&rsquo;d certainly true, that they knowing
<i>Gomez Perez</i> went upon that Expedition, to which he took with him
all the <i>Spaniards</i>, concluded the Country was left defenceless,
and therefore came with a Design to Conquer, or plunder it, which would
have been very easy, had they found it as they expected. They went out
of their Ships but twice to visit <i>Don Lewis</i>, with great State,
and much Attendance. He receiv&rsquo;d them affectionately, and
presented every <i>Mandarine</i> with a gold Chain. They told him, they
came by their King&rsquo;s Order, to pick up the <i>Chineses</i>, who
wander&rsquo;d about those Islands without his Leave; but this was
look&rsquo;d upon as a meer Pretence; because there was no Need, for
that Effect, of so many <i>Mandarines</i>, nor such a Number
<span class="marginnote">Mandarines <i>visit</i> Don Lewis.</span> of
Vessels arm&rsquo;d and furnish&rsquo;d for War. The <i>Chineses</i>
who murder&rsquo;d <i>Gomez Perez</i>, were of <i>Chincheo</i>, and
therefore <i>Don Lewis</i>, as knowing the certain Criminals, sent his
Kinsman <i>Don Ferdinand de Castro</i>, in a Ship, to give the King of
<i>China</i> an Account of that Treachery; but his Voyage
miscarry&rsquo;d, and all was left in Suspence.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>King of</i> Camboxa <i>demands the

<i>Camboxa</i> made Instance for the Succours, and requir&rsquo;d

before. He therefore, in Pursuance to it, and to the End that those
Forces, or some Part of them, might continue in the Church&rsquo;s
Service, since they were provided for that End, in the Design of
<i>Ternate</i>, resolv&rsquo;d to support that King with them.</p>
<p><i>Camboxa</i> is one of the most fertile of the <i>Indian</i>
Regions. It sends <span class="marginnote">Camboxa
<i>described.</i></span> Abundance of Provisions to other Parts, for
which Reason it is frequented by <i>Spaniards</i>, <i>Persians</i>,
<i>Arabs</i>, and <i>Armenians</i>. The King is a <i>Mahometan</i>; but
his Subjects the <i>Gusarats</i> and <i>Banians</i>, follow the
Precepts of <i>Pythagoras</i>, perhaps without any Knowledge of him.
They are all sharp witted, <span class="marginnote"><i>Opinions of the
Natives.</i></span> and reputed the cunningest Merchants in
<i>India</i>. However they are of Opinion, that after Death, Men, Brute
Beasts, and all Creatures, receive either Punishment, or Reward; so
confus&rsquo;d a Notion have they of Immortality. The City
<i>Camboxa</i>, which gives its Name to all the Country, is also
call&rsquo;d <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name=
"pb143">143</a>]</span><i>Champa</i>, abounding in the Odoriferous
<i>Calambuco</i> Wood, whose Tree call&rsquo;d <i>Calamba</i>, grows in
unknown Regions, and therefore has not been seen standing. The Floods
upon those great Rivers bring down Trunks of it, and <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Lignum Aloes.</i></span> this is the precious <i>Lignum
Aloes</i>. <i>Camboxa</i> produces Corn, Rice, Pease, Butter, and Oyl.
There are made in it various Sorts of Cotton Webs, Muslins, Buckrams,
Calicoes, white and painted, Dimities, and other curious <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Manufactures.</i></span> Pieces exceeding the finest in
<i>Holland</i>. They also adorn their Rooms with Carpets; tho&rsquo;
they are not like those brought out of <i>Persia</i> to <i>Ormuz</i>.
They weave others for the common Sort, which they call <i>Bancales</i>,
not unlike the <i>Scotch</i> Plads. Nor do they want the Art of
Silk-Weaving, for they both weave, and work with the Needle, rich
Hangings, Coverings for the low Chairs us&rsquo;d by the Women of
Quality, and for the <i>Indian</i> Litters, or <i>Palanquines</i>,
which are made of Ivory, and Tortoise-Shell, and of the same they make
Chess-Boards, and Tables to Play, Seal-Rings, and other portable
Things. In the Mountains there is found a sort of Christal,
extraordinary <span class="marginnote"><i>Product.</i></span>
transparent, whereof they make Beads, little Idols, Bracelets,
Necklaces, and other Toys. It abounds in Amethists, Garnets, the Sort
of Saphirs call&rsquo;d Hyacinths, Spinets, Cornelians, Chrysolites,
Cats Eyes, properly call&rsquo;d <i>Acates</i>, all of them precious
Stones; There are also those they call Milk, and Blood Stones,
pleasant, and medicinal Fruits, Opium, Bangue, Sanders, Alom and Sugar.
<i>Indigo</i> is incomparably prepar&rsquo;d in <i>Camboxa</i>, and
thence sent to several Provinces. The living Creatures are the same
<i>Asia</i> affords in those Parts, Elephants, Lions, Horses, wild
Boars, <span class="marginnote"><i>Beasts.</i></span> and other fierce
Beasts. It is in Ten Degrees of North Latitude. The River <i>Mecon</i>
waters all the Kingdom, and in it falls into the Sea; being
look&rsquo;d upon as the greatest in <i>India</i>, carrying so much
water in Summer, that it <span class="marginnote">Mecon
<i>River.</i></span> floods, and covers the Fields, like the <i>Nile in
Egypt</i>. It joyns another of less Stock, at the Place call&rsquo;d
<i>Chordemuco</i>. This River, for six Months runs backward. The Reason
of it is the Extent and Plainness of the Country it runs along. The
Southern Breezes choak up the Bar with Sand. The Currents thus
damm&rsquo;d up, swell and rise together, after much Struggling one
against the other. The Bar looks to the South-ward, both Waters at
first Form a deep Bay, and finding no free Passage out, but being drove
by the mighty Violence of the Winds, are forc&rsquo;d to submit and
bend their Course the wrong Way, till a more favourable Season restores
them to their natural Course. We see some such like Effects in
<i>Spain</i>, where the <i>Tagus</i> falls into the Sea of
<i>Portugal</i>, and the <i>Guadalquivir</i> into that of
<i>Andaluzia</i>, oppos&rsquo;d by the superior Force of the Sea Waves,
and of the Winds.</p>
<p>About this Time, in the remotest Part of this Country, beyond
impenetrable <span class="marginnote">Angon <i>City
Discover&rsquo;d.</i></span> Woods, not far from the Kingdom of the
<i>Laos</i>, was discover&rsquo;d a City, of above six thousand Houses,
now call&rsquo;d <i>Angon</i>. The Structures, and Streets, all of
massy Marble Stones, artificially wrought, and as entire, as if they
had been modern Works. The Wall strong, with a Scarp, or Slope within,
in such Manner, that they can go up to the Battlements <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Its Magnificence.</i></span> every where. Those
Battlements all differ one from another, representing sundry Creatures,
one represents the Head of an Elephant, another of a Lion, a third of a
Tiger, and so proceed in continual Variety. The Ditch, which is also of
hew&rsquo;d Stones, is capable of receiving Ships. Over it is a
magnificent Bridge, the Arches of it being supported by stone
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=
"pb144">144</a>]</span>Giants of a prodigious Height. The Aqueducts,
tho&rsquo; dry, show no less Grandeur. There are Remains of Gardens,
and delightful Places, where the Aqueducts terminate. On one Side of
the Town is a Lake above thirty Leagues in Compass. There are Epitaphs,
Inscriptions, and Characters not understood. Many Buildings are more
sumptuous than the rest, most of them of Alabaster, and Jasper Stone.
In all this City, when first discoverred by the Natives, they found no
People, nor Beasts, nor any living Creatures, except such as Nature
produces out of the Breaches of Ruins. I own I was unwilling to write
this, and that I have look&rsquo;d upon it as an imaginary City of
<i>Plato</i>&rsquo;s <i>Atlantis</i>, and of that his Common-Wealth;
but there is no wonderful Thing, or Accident, that is not subject to
much Doubt. It is now Inhabited, and our Religious Men, of the Order of
St. <i>Augustin</i> and St. <i>Dominick</i>, who have Preach&rsquo;d in
those Parts, do testify the Truth of it. A Person of Reputation for his
Learning, conjectures it was the Work of the Emperor <i>Traian</i>; but
tho&rsquo; he extended the Empire more than his Predecessors, I have
not ever Read that he reach&rsquo;d as far as <i>Camboxa</i>. Were the
Histories of the <i>Chineses</i> as well known as ours, they would
inform us, why they abandon&rsquo;d so great a Part of the World; they
would explain the Inscriptions on the Buildings, and all the rest that
is unknown to the Natives themselves. I know not what to say of so
Beautiful a City&rsquo;s being buried in Oblivion, or not known. It is
rather a Subject of Admiration than Reflection.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Three</i> Spanish <i>Ships sent to the
Relief of</i> Camboxa.</span> <i>Don Lewis</i> being zealous to bring
those Nations into the Bosom of the Church, and their Wealth, and Kings
under the Subjection of the Crown of <i>Spain</i>, fitted out three
Ships, under the Command of <i>John Xuarez Gallinato</i>, born at
<i>Tenerife</i>, one of the <i>Canary</i> Islands, with 120
<i>Spaniards</i>, and some <i>Philippines</i>. They Sail&rsquo;d from
<i>Cebu</i>, but there rose a Storm immediately, which dispers&rsquo;d
the Ships. <i>Gallinato</i> drove on by the Fury of the Winds,
arriv&rsquo;d at <i>Malaca</i>, and the other two at <i>Camboxa</i>.
Going up the River, <span class="marginnote"><i>King of</i> Camboxa
<i>routed by him of</i> Siam.</span> they were Inform&rsquo;d, That the
King of <i>Sian</i> had defeated him of <i>Camboxa</i>, his Neighbour;
who, with the wretched Remains of his Army, fled into the Kingdom of
the <i>Laos</i>, a Neighbouring but Inhumane Nation; and that, whilst
he was begging Compassion among those obdurate Hearts, the King of Sian
had set up <i>Prauncar</i>, Nick-nam&rsquo;d, <i>Wry Mouth the
Traytor</i>, Brother to the vanqush&rsquo;d Monarch, for King of
<i>Camboxa</i>. This Accident did not obstruct the Succours which the
<i>Spaniards</i> carry&rsquo;d under Colour of an Embassy. They came to
the City <i>Chordumulo</i>, 80 Leagues distant from the Bar, and
leaving 40 <i>Spaniards</i> in the Ships, 40 others went to the Country
where the new King was. They made Application to visit him presently,
but he would not be seen that Day, tho&rsquo; he order&rsquo;d they
should have good Quarters, and be told, he would give them Audience
three Days after. But <i>James Veloso</i> and <i>Blase Ruyz</i>, either
that they were formerly acquainted <span class="marginnote"><i>Design
to murder the</i> Spaniards.</span> with the Country, or some new
Subtilty occurring, looking on that delay as suspicious, visiting a
beautiful <i>Indian</i> Woman, of the King&rsquo;s Family, she told
them in private, That being admitted into that Tyrants Secrets, he
being fond of her, she knew he intended to Murder them all; and that
during those three Days he had assign&rsquo;d them, as it were to Rest,
after their Journey, the Men and Means for Executing that Design were
to be provided. The <i>Spaniards</i> return&rsquo;d Thanks for the
Intelligence, not without promise of Reward. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Desperat Bravery of the</i>
Spaniards.</span> They were not dismay&rsquo;d at the Danger; but
repeating their Thanks to the <i>Indian</i> Woman, for her
Intelligence, came to this magnanimous, if it may not be term&rsquo;d a
rash Resolution. They agreed to attack the King&rsquo;s Palace that
same Night, and to withstand the whole Army, if Need were. They
prepar&rsquo;d themselves for that Enterprize, which was above human
Strength, set fire to the House where the Powder lay, and the People
running to help, or to see the Mischief, the <i>Spaniards</i>, during
the Confusion, enter&rsquo;d the Palace, and being acquainted with the
royal Apartments, made through them, till they came to the King&rsquo;s
Person, whom they run thro&rsquo;, and kill&rsquo;d <span class=
"marginnote"><i>They kill the King of</i> Camboxa.</span> after cutting
his Guards in Pieces. He defended himself, calling out for Help, but
those who came to his Assistance found him bloodless. The Report of
this Action alarm&rsquo;d the other Guards, and then all the City,
which contains above thirty thousand Inhabitants, who where all running
to Arms; above 14000 Men took up such as Occasion offer&rsquo;d, and
came upon the <i>Spaniards</i> with many war-like Elephants. Our two
Commanders drew up <span class="marginnote"><i>Retire before 14000</i>
Indians.</span> their little Body, and retir&rsquo;d in great Order,
always fighting and killing great numbers of their Enemies. The Fight
lasted all the Night, with wonderful Bravery, the next Day they got to
their Ships, and imbark&rsquo;d, leaving that Kingdom full of new
Divisions.</p>
<p>The second Day after, <i>Gallinato</i> came in, with his Ship. He
landed, having <span class="marginnote">Gallinato <i>at</i>
Camboxa.</span>been before inform&rsquo;d of what had happen&rsquo;d,
and thinking he did not perform his Duty, unless he succour&rsquo;d the
<i>Spaniards</i>, when he heard the Drums and Bells, and saw the
Streets and Port full of trading People, now in Arms. He gave strict
Orders to those that attended him, to behave themselves very modestly,
so as to conceal their own Concern, and deceive the People of
<i>Camboxa</i>, both by their Looks, and the Sedateness of their Words.
The principal Men of <i>Camboxa</i> visited him, in peaceable Manner;
whom he treated very courteously. He might have perform&rsquo;d some
great Exploit, but finding his Strength too small for such an
Enterprize, and that now Affairs had taken another Turn, and were in a
different Posture, he thought fit to be gone. Most of those great Men
oppos&rsquo;d it, promising him the Crown, as being well affected to
the <i>Spaniards</i>, and a foreign Government. <span class=
"marginnote"><i>The great Men offer him the Crown.</i></span> Hence
came the idle Report, that <i>Gallinato</i> was King of <i>Camboxa</i>,
which was believ&rsquo;d by many in <i>Spain</i>, and acted on the
Stage with Applause, and good Liking. And it was the Opinion of Persons
well acquainted with those Countries, that had <i>Gallinato</i> laid
hold of the Opportunity offer&rsquo;d him, he might then have
possess&rsquo;d himself of <i>Camboxa</i>, and united it to the Crown
of <i>Castile</i>.</p>
<p>I have seen Letters of <i>Velloso</i>, and <i>Blase Ruiz</i>, to the
Council at <i>Manila</i>, after this Action, wherein they speak to this
Effect, and complain that <i>Gallinato</i> should blame what they did.
But <i>Gallinato</i>, whose Judgment, and Valour, had been try&rsquo;d
in the greatest Dangers of those Eastern Parts, and many Years before
in <i>Flanders</i>, would not suffer himself to be easily <span class=
"marginnote"><i>The depos&rsquo;d King&rsquo;s Son
restor&rsquo;d.</i></span> led away by popular Affection, and
honourably rejecting that Opportunity, sail&rsquo;d towards
<i>Manila</i>. He took in some Refreshment in <i>Cochinchina</i>.
<i>Blase Ruiz</i> and <i>James Velloso</i> had landed there before, and
went alone by Land to the Kingdom of the <i>Laos</i>, which lies West
of <i>Cochinchina</i>, to seek out the depos&rsquo;d King
<i>Langara</i>, and restore him to his Throne. They found he was dead,
but had a Son living, who being told how they had kill&rsquo;d the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name=
"pb146">146</a>]</span>Usurper, his Uncle and Enemy; he set forward
immediately for his Kingdom with <i>Velloso</i> and <i>Ruiz</i>, and
10000 Men, the King of the <i>Laos</i>, contrary to all Expectation
furnish&rsquo;d him. He attack&rsquo;d <i>Camboxa</i>, where
<i>Ruiz</i> and <i>Velloso</i> faithfully stuck to him during the War,
and afterwards in his Government. Then he sent another Embassy to the
<i>Philippine</i> Island, asking Supplies of Men to quell the Troubles
in his Country, and that he and his Subjects might receive the Faith of
<i><span class="ex">JESUS CHRIST</span></i>; promising a considerable
Part of his Dominions to the <i>Spaniards</i>, to subsist them. This
Embassy came to <i>Manila</i>, when <i>Don Lewis</i> had quitted the
Government, and resign&rsquo;d it up to <i>Don Francis Tello</i>, which
gave Occasion to <i>Ternate</i> to grow more settled in its
Tyranny.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">D. Pedro de Acunna <i>fortifies</i>

<i>Carthagena</i> in the <i>West-Indies</i>, in this Year 1595, either
because it was his natural Inclination, or the Necessity of the Times
requiring it, fortify&rsquo;d the Place with Fascines, Planks, Piles,
and Ditches, working at it himself in Person. Thus he oblig&rsquo;d the
Bishop, Clergy and Religious Men, to put their Hands to the Work; the
very Ladies of Quality, their Daughters and Maids, did not refuse to
follow such an Example. It was wonderful to see with what Expedition
and Zeal the Work was brought to Perfection, of such Force is a good
Example. Soon after came to <i>Puerto Rico</i>, the Ship call&rsquo;d
<i>Pandorga</i>, or <i>Borgonna</i>, that was Admiral of <i>Tierra
Firme</i>, and <i>New Spain</i>, with three Millions in her. The whole
under the Care of the General <i>Sancho Pardo</i>.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">56 English <i>Sail sent to rob the

Hawkins</i> and <i>Francis Drake</i>. Captain <i>Peter Tello</i>
defended the three Millions so bravely with the <i>Spanish</i> Frigots,
that he sav&rsquo;d the Prize. <i>Hawkins</i> was wounded in the Fight,
and dy&rsquo;d of it before he could come to the Firm Land.
<i>Drake</i>, with that Fleet, enter&rsquo;d <i>Rio de la Hacha</i> and
<i>Santa Maria</i>; and being one Night in Sight of <i>Carthagena</i>,
took a Frigate belonging to that Coast, by which he was inform&rsquo;d,
how well the Governour had fortifi&rsquo;d it; therefore making a
Compliment of Necessity, he sent <i>Don Pedro</i> a Message by the Men
of his Frigot, whom he therefore set at Liberty, saying, He did not
attack his Works and City out of Respect to him, and because he
honour&rsquo;d his Valour. The Truth of the Matter was, That
<i>Drake</i> call&rsquo;d together his Captains to consult what was to
be done, and they all advis&rsquo;d him to attack the City, promising
to do their utmost, and be answerable for the Success; alledging it
ought to be attempted, for being a Place of vast Wealth and
Consequence. Only <i>Drake</i> oppos&rsquo;d it, <span class=
"marginnote">Drake<i>&rsquo;s Actions there</i>.</span>
strength&rsquo;ning his Opinion by saying, His Mind did not give him,
that the Enterprize could have the Success they would assure him,
because they were to have to do with a Knight of <i>Malta</i>, a
Batchelor, nothing weakned with Womanish Affection, or the Care of
Children; but watchful, and intent upon defending the Place, and so
Resolute, that he would dye on the Spot before he would lose it. This
Opinion prevail&rsquo;d, and the <i>English</i> standing in Awe of
<i>Don Pedro&rsquo;s</i> Reputation, went away to the Town of <i>Nombre
de Dios</i>, and took it. <i>Drake</i> afterwards designing to do the
same at <i>Panama</i>, was disappointed, meeting Opposition by the Way,
which had been provided upon the Advice sent by <i>Don Pedro</i>, that
the <i>English</i> were moving against that City. <span class=

<p>But let us return into <i>Asia</i>. Still the People of
<i>Camboxa</i> persisted to ask Succours at the <i>Philipine</i>
Islands, upon the usual Promise of Conversion and Vassalage. <i>Don
Lewis de las Marinhas</i> undertook the Enterprize in Person,
<span class="marginnote">D. Lewis de las Marinhas <i>goes to

<i>Manila</i> with <i>Don James Jordan</i>, an <i>Italian</i>, <i>Don
Pedro de Figueroa</i>, <i>Peter Villestil</i>, and <i>Ferdinand de los
Rios Coronel</i>, <i>Spanish</i> Commanders, the last of them then a
Priest, who had also been in the first War of <i>Camboxa</i>. A Storm
took them out at Sea, which lasted three Days, with the usual Fury. The
Shipwrack was miserable, two Ships were stav&rsquo;d in Pieces, and the
Sea swallow&rsquo;d up all the Men, Provisions and Ammunition. Of all
the Soldiers and Seamen on Board the Vice-Admiral, only five swam
ashore on the Coast of <i>China</i>. Some Soldiers were also
sav&rsquo;d out of the Admiral, and among them Captain <i>Ferdinand de
los Rios</i>, the Vessel remaining founder&rsquo;d under the Waves. The
other Ship got to <i>Camboxa</i> almost shatter&rsquo;d to Pieces after
<span class="marginnote"><i>Is cast away.</i></span> many Dangers. She
found in the River of <i>Camboxa</i>, eight Juncks of <i>Malayes</i>,
and the <i>Spaniards</i> seeing they design&rsquo;d to carry away some
Slaves of the King of <i>Camboxa</i>, to whose Assistance they came,
inconsiderately boarded the <i>Malayes</i>, who being well
furnish&rsquo;d with more than ordinary Fire-works, soon burnt our
Ship, and most of the <i>Spaniards</i> perish&rsquo;d in the
<span class="marginnote">Spanish <i>Ships burnt</i>.</span> Flames or
Smoke. <i>Blaze Ruiz</i>, nor <i>Velloso</i> were not there at that
Time, but soon after in the Country, where they were attending the
King, being beset in the House where they lodg&rsquo;d, were
barbarously murder&rsquo;d. Those few <i>Spaniards</i> that
escap&rsquo;d, got into the Kingdom of <i>Sian</i>, and thence to
<i>Manila</i>. Heaven was pleas&rsquo;d this should be the End of all
those mighty Preparations made for the Recovery of <i>Ternate</i>, and
the other <i>Molucco</i> Islands, whose Tyrant triumph&rsquo;d at the
News, concluding it was the Effect of his good Fortune, and looking on
it as a Testimony of the Justice of his Cause, and accordingly he
confederated a new with our Enemies.</p>
<p><i>Don Francisco Tello</i>, a Gentleman of <i>Andaluzia</i>,
succeeded <i>Gomez Perez</i> <span class="marginnote">D. Fran. Tello
<i>Governor of the</i> Phil.</span> in the Government of the
<i>Philippine</i> Islands, and came to <i>Manila</i> in the Year 1596.
His first Care was to inform himself of the Condition his Predecessor
had left them in, and to supply the Garrisons; because the Emperor of
<i>Japan</i>, having in the Year 1595, executed those glorious
Martyrdoms, the Memory whereof is still fresh, on the Religious Men of
the Order of <i>S. Francis</i>, it gave him Jealousy, that he might
have a Design against the <i>Philippine</i> Islands.</p>
<p>The Natives of the Islands of <i>Mindanao</i>, hate our Nation as
much as <span class="marginnote"><i>People of</i> Mindanao <i>hate
the</i> Spaniards.</span> those of <i>Ternate</i>, and upon any
Occasion take Arms against it, as they did in the last, at the said
Island of <i>Ternate</i>. For this Reason, <i>Stephen Rodriguez de
Figueroa</i> enter&rsquo;d into Articles with the new Governour. <i>Don
Francisco Tello</i>, by Virtue whereof he made War on the People of
<i>Mindanao</i> and <i>Ternate</i>, at his own Expence. <i>Stephen
Rodriguez</i> was so rich, <span class="marginnote">Stephen Rodriguez
<i>makes War on</i> Mindanao, <i>at his own Expence</i>.</span> that he
might safely undertake this Affair. He liv&rsquo;d at <i>Arevalo</i>, a
Town on the Island <i>Panaz</i>, one of the <i>Philippines</i>, and set
out with some Galleys, Frigots, Champanes, and one Ship, in which there
were some <i>Spaniards</i>, and above 1500 of the Painted Natives,
call&rsquo;d <i>Pintados</i>, who were to serve as Pioneers. He
arriv&rsquo;d at the River of <i>Mindanao</i>, on the 20th of
<i>April</i>, 1596, and as soon as the Inhabitants of the Town,
peculiarly call&rsquo;d <i>Mindanao</i>, saw such a sightly Company,
they fled up the Side of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href=
"#pb148" name="pb148">148</a>]</span>the River, abandoning the Place,
to the Fury of the Soldiers. Most of them resorted to the Town of
<i>Buyahen</i>, then the Residence of <i>Raxamura</i>, King of
<i>Mindanao</i>, who being under Age, had yet no Charge of the
Government, which was wholly in the Hands of <i>Silonga</i>, a Soldier,
and Commander of Reputation. Our Men following up the River, came to
<i>Tampacan</i>, five Leagues from the first. That Place was
govern&rsquo;d by <i>Dinguilibot</i>, Uncle to <i>Monao</i>, the true
Proprietor, who was then also young.</p>
<p>These two were naturally well affected to the <i>Spaniards</i>, and
therefore, as soon as they discover&rsquo;d their Arms, came out, in
peaceable Manner, to meet, <span class="marginnote"><i>The Natives fly,
and he pursues.</i></span> and offer them their Assistance. They
inform&rsquo;d them, that the Enemies, for they were so to those of
<i>Buyahen</i>, had retir&rsquo;d into the Fort they had there.
<i>Stephen Rodriguez</i> hearing the News, and having made much of
those Princes, order&rsquo;d the Fleet to weigh Anchor, and continue
the Pursuit, four Leagues farther, still along the River, to
<i>Buyahen</i>. Being come thither, he landed his Men on <i>S.
Mark</i>&rsquo;s Day; which was done by the Col. <i>John de Xara</i>,
but without any Order, because having had no Engagement at
<i>Mindanao</i>, they thought they should have little to do there; as
if this, or any other Pretence ought to be an Excuse for not observing
Martial Discipline, <i>Stephen Rodriguez</i> would land to rectify that
Disorder by his Presence. He went out in such Armour of Proof, that a
Shot of a small Drake would scarce pierce it. Only his Head
unarm&rsquo;d, but cover&rsquo;d with a Cap and Feather, a black
carrying his Helmet, and five Soldiers well arm&rsquo;d attending him.
He had scarce march&rsquo;d fifty Paces, before an <i>Indian</i>, whose
Name was <i>Ubal</i>, suddenly rush&rsquo;d out of a close and topping
Thicket, and running <span class="marginnote"><i>Is
kill&rsquo;d.</i></span> at him, with his <i>Campilan</i>, or Cymiter,
clove his Head. <i>Ubal</i> was Brother to <i>Silonga</i>, and Owner of
one only Cow there was in all that Country. He kill&rsquo;d her three
Days before this Accident, and inviting his Friends to her,
promis&rsquo;d in that War to kill the most noted Man among the
<i>Spaniards</i>. He was as good as his Word, for <i>Stephen
Rodriguez</i> dropt down of the Wound, and dy&rsquo;d three Days after,
without answering one Word to the Questions that were made him,
tho&rsquo; he did it by Signs. The five <i>Spaniards</i>, seeing their
Commander so suddenly wounded, that the Slayer, appeared, and the
Stroke was heard the same Moment, fell upon <i>Ubal</i> and cut him in
Pieces. They acquainted Colonel <i>Xara</i> with their General&rsquo;s
Death; <span class="marginnote"><i>A Fort erected in</i> Mindanao
<i>and call&rsquo;d New</i> Murcia.</span> and he suppressing his
Concern, drew back the Men, and threw up a Fortification in the most
convenient Place, near the River, where he orderly founded his Colony,
to be inhabited by our Men. He appointed Aldermen, and Magistrates,
calling it <i>New Murcia</i>, in Honour of the old one in <i>Spain</i>,
where he was born. Afterwards, designing to marry <i>Donna Ana de
Oseguera</i>, Widow to <i>Stephen Rodriguez</i>, he left Things
unsettled, and arriv&rsquo;d at the Island <i>Luzon</i> about the
Beginning of <i>June</i>.</p>
<p>The Governor <i>Don Francis Tello</i>, who was then at the Place
call&rsquo;d <i>El Embocadero</i>, an hundred Leagues from
<i>Manila</i>, being inform&rsquo;d of what had happen&rsquo;d, and
told upon what design the Colonel <i>Xara</i> came, seiz&rsquo;d him
immediately, <span class="marginnote"><i>Cap.</i> Miranda <i>sent
to</i> Mindanao.</span> sending <i>Captain Toribio de Miranda</i>, to
the War in <i>Mindanao</i>. He found his Men were retire&rsquo;d to the
Port <i>de la Caldera</i>, in the same Island but 36 Leagues from the
Mouth of the River. There he maintain&rsquo;d himself, till about
<i>August Don Francis Tello</i> appointed <i>Don John Ronquillo</i>,
who was Commander of the Galleys, to succeed in that Post. He also
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span>commission&rsquo;d <i>Peter Arceo
Covarrubias</i>, and others, as Captains, to go with him; <i>James
Chaves Cannizares</i>, Collonel; <i>Garcia Guerrero</i>, Major; and
<i>Christopher Villagra</i> and <i>Cervan Gutierrez</i>, Captains of
Foot. <i>Don John Ronquillo</i> came with his Recruit to press upon the
Enemy, and did it so effectually, that being distress&rsquo;d, they
crav&rsquo;d Aid of the King of <i>Ternate</i>, to whom the People of
<i>Mindanao</i> pay an Acknowledgement, which is little less, or the
same as Tribute. <i>Buizan</i>, Brother to <i>Silonga</i>, went on this
Embassy; <span class="marginnote">Ternates <i>Succour</i>
Mindanao.</span> and succeeded so well, that the King of <i>Ternate</i>
sent with him seven <i>Carcoas</i>, x heavy Pieces of Cannon, two
smaller, some Falconets, and six hundred Men. They sailing up the River
of <i>Mindanao</i>, design&rsquo;d to pass on as far as <i>Buyahen</i>;
but met with great Difficulties at the Reaches; because at one of them
they were threatned by the <i>Spaniards</i> chief Fort, the Galleys,
and other Vessels; and the other was a narrow Channel, with a Point
running out into it, on which was erected a Bastion, defended by forty
Men. From thence our Men had artificially laid a strong wooden Bridge
over to the other Side of the River, close to which a Galliot
ply&rsquo;d up and down.</p>
<p>The <i>Ternates</i> seeing both Sides so well Guarded,
resolv&rsquo;d to fortify themselves at the Mouth of the River. They
accordingly erected a small <span class="marginnote"><i>They build a
Fort on the River.</i></span> Fort, and put themselves into it, with an
equal Number of <i>Mindanao</i> Soldiers. The News hereof mov&rsquo;d
the General <i>Ronquillo</i> to dislodge them; and in Order to it, came
down with the Galleys and other Vessels, and 140 Men well appointed. He
landed with 116, and the Captains <i>Ruy Gomez Arellano</i>, <i>Garcia
Guerrero</i>, <i>Christopher Villagra</i>, and <i>Alonso de Palma</i>,
facing the Enemy, at about eighty Paces Distance, on the Bank of the
River. The <i>Ternates</i> and <i>Mindanaos</i> had levell&rsquo;d all
the Front of their Fort, and designedly left a Spot of Bushes and
Brambles on one Side, where 300 <i>Ternates</i> lay in Ambush, the rest
being in the Fort. Both their Parties perceiving how few of our Men
came to attack them, were asham&rsquo;d to be shut up within
Fortifications, and lye in Ambush, and accordingly making Show of
haughty Threats, came out and met the <i>Spaniards</i>. They found such
Opposition, that without the Help of any Stratagem, or other Cause but
their natural Valour, at the very first onset, almost all the
<i>Ternates</i> were kill&rsquo;d, <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Slaughter of</i> Ternates.</span> and the rest fled.
Our Men follow&rsquo;d the Chace, till they made an End of them. The
people of <i>Tampaca</i>, who till then had been Neuters, to see which
Side Fortune would favour, perceiving she declar&rsquo;d for us, took
up Arms for our Part. Only seventy seven escap&rsquo;d dangerously
wounded, whereof fifty were drown&rsquo;d in the River leaping, into it
in Despair: Of the other twenty seven, only three surviv&rsquo;d, who
carry&rsquo;d the News to their <span class="marginnote"><i>Only three
escape.</i></span> King. The <i>Spaniards</i> possess&rsquo;d
themselves of the Shipping, Cannon, and Plunder of the
vanquish&rsquo;d, and were encourag&rsquo;d to prosecute the War.</p>
<p><i>Don Francis Tello</i> did not neglect other <span class="corr"
id="xd21e17426" title="Source: Affais">Affairs</span> of this Nature.
He understood by his Spyes, and it was bruited abroad, that the Emperor
of <i>Japan</i> <span class="marginnote"><i>Warlike preparations in</i>
Japan.</span> was gathering a mighty Army, and fitted out a Fleet for
it, with Arms and Provisions. It was also known, that he was in Treaty
to secure himself against the <i>Chineses</i>, of whom the
<i>Japoneses</i> are naturally Jealous. Hence it was inferr&rsquo;d,
that he arm&rsquo;d to carry the War out of his own Dominions. He had
already enter&rsquo;d into Allyance with the King of <i>Ternate</i>,
and other Neighbours, who were Enemies to the Crown of <i>Spain</i>.
All <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name=
"pb150">150</a>]</span>these Particulars gave vehement Cause to
conjecture, that the Storm threatned the <i>Philippine</i> Islands, and
more especially <i>Manila</i>, the Head of them. The Governour
strengthned himself, and sent Captain <i>Alderete</i> to discover the
whole Truth, under Colour of complimenting that Emperour, and carrying
<span class="marginnote"><i>A</i> Spanish <i>Embassy
thither</i>.</span> him a Present. The Embassador set out for
<i>Japan</i> in <i>July</i>, and at the same Time <i>Don Francisco</i>
dispatch&rsquo;d the Galeon <i>S. Philip</i> for <i>New Spain</i>, with
Advice of those Reports. These two Ships, viz. that <i>Alderete</i>
went in, and the <i>S. Philip</i>, were together in <i>Japan</i>, which
the Natives were jealous of. <i>Alderete</i> got full Information of
the Strength and Designs of the <i>Japoneses</i>, and his Industry was
of Use, for the taking of right Measures in <i>Manila</i>, and to
prevent their fearing without Cause. He brought back another noble
Present to the Governour; and both Sides stood upon their Guard, to be
ready upon all Occasions.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Sovereign Court at</i> Manila.</span> In
the Year 1598, the sovereign Court was again erected at <i>Manila</i>,
King <i>Philip</i> prudently conferring Dignity on that Province. It
was compos&rsquo;d of the Iudges <i>Zambrano</i>, <i>Mezcoa</i>,
<i>Tellez de Almazan</i>, and the Kings Attorney <i>Jerome Salazar, y
Salcedo</i>. That great King never allow&rsquo;d of any Intermission in
his weighty Cares, which extended to all the known Parts of the World;
having a watchful Eye upon the Designs of other Princes, whether well,
or ill affected to the Propagation of the Gospel, which was his main
Design<span class="corr" id="xd21e17529" title="Source: ,">.</span>
Therefore, about this Time, he made Haste to rid himself of his
neighbouring Enemies, that he might have Leasure to attend the remotest
Rebels against the Church and his Monarchy. And in Respect that as
<span class="marginnote"><i>Peace between</i> France &amp;
Spain.</span> Age came on, its Distempers grew heavier, he concluded a
Peace with <i>France</i>, which was proclaim&rsquo;d at <i>Madrid</i>,
with Martial Solemnity, after he had withdrawn himself to the Monastery
of <i>S. Laurence</i>, at the <i>Escurial</i>, <span class=

extreme Unction, the last Remedy for temporal, and eternal Health. His
Death was in all Respects answerable to the wonderful Course of his
Life.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">K. Philip <i>the 3d</i>.</span> King

upon the Throne. The same Unanimity was found in the Fleet, and Naval

title="Source: obe &rsquo;d">obey&rsquo;d</span> without any Commotion,
or rather with Pride, as if it knew and were sensible of the new Hand
that took up the Reins of Government. Excellent Princes have seldom
fail&rsquo;d to employ extraordinary Ministers about their Persons, to
manage and sustain the Burden their Fortune lays upon their Shoulders;
so <i>Alexander</i> the Great had <i>Hephestion</i>; the two
<i>Scipios</i>, the two <i>Lelij</i>; <i>Augustus C&aelig;sar</i>,
<i>Marcus Agrippa</i>; the Princes of the August House of
<i>Austria</i>, other Persons of singular Virtue; for all moral Wisdom,
and Experience it self teaches us, that the Difficulties of weighty
Affairs are not to be duly manag&rsquo;d, and surmounted, by any but
Persons of a more than ordinary Capacity; because Nature has not left
any of its Works destitute of a proportionable Ministry. And
considering, that it is of great Importance to the publick Welfare, to
contrive, that what is necessary for the Use and Commerce of Mankind
may appear eminent in Dignity, for the strengthning of the common
Advantage with Authority: The King, I say, following those ancient
Examples, made Choice of <i>Don Francisco de Rojas y Sandoval</i>, then
Marques of <i>Denia</i>, and since first Duke of <i>Lerma</i>, a most
<span class="marginnote"><i>Duke of</i> Lerma <i>Prime
Minister.</i></span> able Minister, privately to consult with him about
fundamental Matters and Concerns, for which he had been prepar&rsquo;d
with singular Affection in those Times: Besides the great Antiquity of
his Family, which has ally&rsquo;d him to all the noblest of the
<i>Grandees</i> of <i>Spain</i>, all Men own him endow&rsquo;d with the
necessary Virtues, that belong to a Person in so great a Post; which
shine through that pleasing Gravity of his Countenance, with a
stay&rsquo;d Gayity that testifies his Capacity, and provokes Respect
at the same Time that it gains Affections. He constituted him the first
of his Council of State, and all the Orders for Peace and War began to
run through his Hands. All the Opinions of Councels, which he found
seal&rsquo;d, for King <i>Philip</i> the 2d to give his Decision
thereupon, he restor&rsquo;d, without opening them, to the Presidents
of the said Councels they came from, being, perhaps, calculated out of
Respect, that they might again debate upon them with more Liberty, and
send them back enlarg&rsquo;d or reform&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>Heaven was now hastening the Reduction of the <i>Molucco</i>
Islands, and the <span class="marginnote"><i>Neglect of the</i>
Moluccos <i>in</i> Spain.</span> punishing the Persecution of the
faithfull, tho the Tyrants appear&rsquo;d never so haughty; however the
Talk of it was discontinu&rsquo;d for some Time; because the Enterprize
was to be concerted, and carry&rsquo;d on in the <i>Philippine</i>
Islands, and to be resolv&rsquo;d on, and encourag&rsquo;d in the
supreme Council of the <i>Indies</i>, and it was requisite that the
President and Councellors should be well affected to the Cause, which
had then no Body to support it, as being despair&rsquo;d of by Reason
of so many unfortunate Attempts: and therefore the Papers of
Reflections, and Informations relating to it, lay by, forgotten, in
Heaps. This was the Posture of those Affairs till Providence
dispos&rsquo;d the Means for bringing it about, that a Matter which was
difficult on so many several Accounts, might fall into the Hands of a
Sovereign, who being well affected, might with special Zeal bring it to
Perfection.</p>
<p>No Body now disturb&rsquo;d the King of <i>Ternate</i>. The
<i>English</i> settled on his Lands, and Trade enrich&rsquo;d the
Sovereign and the Subjects. He, tho&rsquo; he had many Sons, and the
Prince his Successor was of Age to bear Arms, did not cease equally to
increase his Wives and Concubines. Lust was never circumscrib&rsquo;d
by any Laws among those People. The Relations of curious Persons inform
us, That among the rest of this Kings Wives, there was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name=
"pb152">152</a>]</span><span class="marginnote"><i>Queen of</i> Ternate

<i>Gariolano</i> fell in Love, and she rejected not his Courtship
tho&rsquo; she was Wife to his Father: But that Nearness of Blood
secur&rsquo;d their Familiarity, and under the Shelter, and Cover of
it, she admitted both Father and Son.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Sangiack of</i> Sabubu <i>Father to

<i>Sabubu</i>, a potent Prince in the great Island <i>Batochina</i>,
who came to <i>Ternate</i>, upon some slight Occasion. He being lodged
in the Palace, and entertain&rsquo;d as a Father, and Father-in-Law,
easily saw into the Incestuous Life of his Daughter. He resolv&rsquo;d
to be thoroughly convinc&rsquo;d, yet concealing his Jealousy from both
the Lovers, he was satisfy&rsquo;d of the Truth, learnt who were the
Parties privy to it, abhorr&rsquo;d the Baseness, and condemn&rsquo;d
his own Blood. He pretended one day he would Dine in private, and sent
only for his Daughter; who being free <span class="marginnote"><i>He
Poisons her.</i></span> from all Jealousy or Suspition, swallow&rsquo;d
a Poison, which soon took away her Life, in that Food which she
us&rsquo;d most to delight in. Endeavours were us&rsquo;d to help the
unhappy Queen, and compose the Father; but he angrily obstructing that
last act of Compassion, put away the Physitians, and Women, and being
left alone with the King, who, upon hearing the News, was come to give
his Assistance, said, <i>This Woman, whom Nature gave to me for a
Daughter, and I to you for a Wife, has, with her Life, satisfy&rsquo;d
a Debt she had contracted by her inordinate Passions. Do not Lament
her, or believe she dy&rsquo;d of any Natural Distemper. I killd her,
taking the Revenge off your Hands. The Prince, your Son, had a Love
Intrigue with her? Being in your House I had full Proof of it, and not
being able to endure, that my Blood should wrong you, I could lay aside
all Fatherly Affection, and take away the Stain that on my Side is laid
upon the Law of Nature, and your Honour. I have honourably
finish&rsquo;d the first Part of this Example. Now, if you think your
self wrong&rsquo;d by your Son, he is in your Power, and I have no
Right to deliver him up to you, as I do this false Body. It lies upon
you to finish this Work upon the Offender, for I have perform&rsquo;d
all that was my Duty in giving you this Information, and depriving my
self of the Daughter I lov&rsquo;d best.</i></p>
<p>The King was astonish&rsquo;d, without knowing how to return Thanks,
or perform any other Act becoming a King; and having lamented the
Misfortune for some time, order&rsquo;d Prince <i>Gariolano</i> to be
secur&rsquo;d; but he, who was no less belov&rsquo;d by the Guards than
his Father, Guessing at the Consequences, <span class=

deduc&rsquo;d from the Queens violent Death, sparing no Horse-flesh,
made to the Sea-Port, where he withdrew, with some of his Relations,
from his Fathers Presence and Anger, till it naturally cool&rsquo;d. It
happen&rsquo;d as he expected, for he was appeased before a Year
expir&rsquo;d, and the <span class="marginnote"><i>Is Restor&rsquo;d to

then making a Jest of the Stains of his Honour, and saying, <i>He well

observe, who is guided by his Appetite? And how can he weigh the Duties
of Honour, who Thinks that only the common Actions of the Sense have
any solid being?</p>

never went seriously about recovering those Islands, either because he

<p>We have already mention&rsquo;d the first coming of the

in punishing, as was intended, those who had the Boldness to attempt
that unthought-of Passage. Since then, the <i>Hollanders</i>
<span class="marginnote">Dutch <i>at the</i> Moluccos.</span> and
<i>Zealanders</i>, supported by Rebellion and Disobedience, have
sail&rsquo;d into <i>India</i>, possess&rsquo;d themselves of strong
Holds, and erected Factories, transporting the Drugs, Precious Stones
and Silks of <i>Asia</i>; and what is worse, possessing themselves of
several Places, and rending the <i>Spanish</i> Monarchy. They have made
several Voyages. What Island have they not pry&rsquo;d into? What
Barbarous Nation have they not encourag&rsquo;d to Rebellion and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=
"pb154">154</a>]</span>Tyranny; especially since <i>Maurice</i> of
<i>Nassau</i> is possess&rsquo;d of those Provinces, by the Title of
Governour.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Philippines <i>fill&rsquo;d with</i>
Chineses.</span> The <i>Philippine</i> Islands were now appointed for
the Place of Arms, considering the great Delays Experience had shown
there were towards Recovering of the <i>Molucco</i> Islands. In the
mean while, notwithstanding that <i>Don Francis Tello</i> was
warn&rsquo;d, how pernicious Inhabitants he was like to have in the
<i>Sangleyes</i>, or <i>Chineses</i>, by whom the Islands of his
Province began to be much peopled and fill&rsquo;d, yet he
allow&rsquo;d them greater Liberty than was convenient; and the
Municipal Laws which provided against this Disorder being forgotten or
contemn&rsquo;d, in a very short Time there were additional Towns of
<i>Chineses</i>, <i>Chincheos</i>, and other such like Monsters, who
were no better than Pyrates, or Incendiaries in that Country, which
ought to have taken sufficient Warning by, and been well provided on
Account of past Accidents, to shut up all Passages against such Enemy
Nations. <i>Don Francisco</i> excus&rsquo;d their Resort, alledging,
That they imported Abundance of Provisions and Merchandise, which is
what usually enriches all Places; That no Men have such a consummate
Mechanick Genius as they; That they are more assiduous and constant at
the Works and Buildings than the Natives of the <i>Philippines</i>. He
said, That all the Jealousy generally conceiv&rsquo;d of them vanishes,
if the Governour administers Justice impartially, and permits no
private Cabals. All these are, or appear&rsquo;d to be frivolous
Reasons, without any Force; and the admitting of such an Inundation of
those People, prov&rsquo;d very dangerous, as may be seen in the Sequel
of this Work, by what happen&rsquo;d to the Governour <i>Gomez
Perez</i>. It was a particular Providence of Heaven, that other Nations
did not go about to League with this, or the <i>Dutch</i>, who have so
strongly fix&rsquo;d themselves in the <i>Archipelago</i>; for they
might, without much Difficulty, have given us more Trouble than has
been occasion&rsquo;d by the Rebellion of the Kings of the
<i>Moluccos</i>; to whose Country, and all others in <i>India</i>,
great Fleets of <i>Dutch</i> resort, ever since the Year 1585, whereof
<i>Dutch</i> Writers give an Account, and lay down in Cuts, even the
smallest Plants they produce.</p>
<p>It does not belong to us to give an Account of the <i>English</i>,
<i>Dutch</i>, or other Nations of <i>India</i> and <i>Asia</i>, or
their Expeditions and Voyages; but only such as relate to the Conquest
of <i>Ternate</i> and the <i>Molucco</i> Islands, or may have some
Dependance on this Subject; but be it known, once for all, that every
Year, some Northern Fleets appear&rsquo;d, coming either thro&rsquo;
<i>New Streights</i>, still unknown to our Discoverers, or those before
frequented and laid down. But before we enter upon this Relation, it
seems requisite to say something of <i>Holland</i>, the Head of the
Neighbouring Islands, as that which is become most outrageous in
<i>India</i>, and most covets the <span class="marginnote"><i>Account
of</i> Holland.</span> <i>Moluccos</i>. The province of <i>Holland</i>
is almost on all Sides encompass&rsquo;d by the Sea, and the Ports of
the <i>Maese</i> and <i>Rhine</i>, for about 60 Leagues in Compass.
Within it are contain&rsquo;d 29 wall&rsquo;d Towns, whose Names and
Situation does not belong to us to speak of, nor of those of
<i>Zealand</i>, or the other Provinces subject to them. The Curious may
read <i>Lambert</i>, <i>Hortensius</i>, and <i>Montesortius</i>. The
Natives are descended from the Ancient <i>Catti</i>; and forasmuch as
<i>Erasmus</i> of <i>Rotterdam</i>, which is in <i>Holland</i>,
describes it in his <i>Chiliades</i>, we will abridge what he there
delivers at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name=
"pb155">155</a>]</span>large, out of Affection to his Country. The
Learned, say he, agree, and it is a probable Conjecture, that the
Island <i>Tacitus</i> mentions, lying from <span class=
"marginnote">Tacitus <i>l.</i> 20.</span> the <i>Rhine</i> to the
Ocean, is that we call <i>Holland</i>; which I am oblig&rsquo;d to
Honour, as owing my first Breath to it; and would to God we could
honour it as it deserves. <i>Martial</i> charges it with being rude, or
unpolished; and <i>Lucan</i> with Cruelty. Either these Things do not
belong to us, but to our Ancestors, or we may value our selves upon
them both. What Nation is now known, whose first Fathers were not more
uncouth than their Posterity? Or when was <i>Rome</i> more highly
commended, than when its People knew no other Arts but Tillage and
Warfare? <i>Erasmus</i> spends Time in proving, that it is the Nature
of <i>Holland</i>, not to relish <i>Martial</i>&rsquo;s Wit; and that
this is not the Effect of Rudeness, but a Gravity worthy Imitation.
Then he makes an Exclamation, saying, Would to God all Christians had
<i>Dutch</i> Ears! And that if still any one shall contend, the Nation
is in the Wrong, in having stopp&rsquo;d theirs to all Poetical
Delights and Allurements, and arm&rsquo;d it self against them; the
<i>Dutch</i> valu&rsquo;d themselves upon being comprehended in that
Reflection, which did not displease the Ancient <i>Sabines</i>, the
Perfect <i>Lacedemonians</i>, and the Severe <i>Catos</i>. <i>Lucan</i>
call&rsquo;d the <i>Batavi</i>, that is the <i>Dutch</i>, Cruel, as
<i>Virgil</i> did the <i>Romans</i>, Vehement. <i>Erasmus</i> adds,
That the Customs of these Nations <span class="marginnote">Erasmus
<i>of the Manners of</i> Hollanders.</span> are Familiar, inclining to
Meekness and Benignity, and not to Fierceness; because Nature
endow&rsquo;d them with a sincere Disposition, free from Fraud and
Double-Dealing, and did not make them subject to extraordinary Vices,
except the Love of Pleasure, and Excess in Entertainments. This is
caus&rsquo;d by the Multitude of Beauties, which are Incentives, by the
several Sea-Ports on the Ocean, the Mouths of the two Rivers,
<i>Rhine</i> and <i>Maese</i>; the perpetual Felicity of the Soil,
water&rsquo;d by other Navigable Rivers; and the Fish and Foul in the
Ponds and Woods. No Province of so small a Compass, contains so many
Cities of a considerable Magnitude, and so Populous, excellently
govern&rsquo;d; so full of Commodities, Arts and Trade. It abounds in
Men indifferently learn&rsquo;d. <i>Erasmus</i> himself, in Conclusion,
owns that none of them arrives to singular Erudition. This Account,
which in all that is natural must be own&rsquo;d not to exceed, affords
Arguments to condemn and convince the Author of it, and the Nation it
self. All that Part of the World where Religion and Politeness
flourish, is acquainted with the Diversity of Opinions all those
Nations espouse, of <i>Protestants</i>, <i>Puritans</i>,
<i>Calvinists</i>, these the most Numerous; <i>Huguenots</i>,
<i>Lutherans</i>, and all other Sorts, too long to enumerate, and not
to our Purpose. Since <i>Erasmus</i> confesses that his Country does
not produce any Persons of eminent Learning, why do they take upon them
to decide Controversies in Religion? Why do they incroach upon
Councils? If they are of such an excellent Disposition, and have such a
modest Genius, <span class="marginnote"><i>The Authors Reflections on
them.</i></span> Why do they cast off that Piety, whereof there are
such ancient Testimonies in our first Fathers, so much honour&rsquo;d
by the primitive Charity of the true Church? It is true, as
<i>Erasmus</i> says, that they are of a kind Temper, but Tenacious of
whatsoever they once espouse; the same moves us to pity them the more,
for the Difficulty of dealing with Positiveness in Minds that are not
given to change. Let no Man believe but that under that seeming
Meekness in Behaviour, the highest Degree of Pride lies <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=
"pb156">156</a>]</span><span class="marginnote"><i>A</i> Spanish
<i>Author cannot forbear these Reflections</i>.</span> couch&rsquo;d.
What greater Pride than to scoff at the most ancient Church? At its
Apostolical Traditions? At her universal Agreement? At the Miracles God
has wrought, to approve the Catholick Doctrine? And what Error can be
more inexcusable, than to follow the New Opinions of unlearned and
vicious Men, such as the Arch-Hereticks were; and to live under a
Necessity of not laying down their seditious Arms only to defend
Impiety grounded on Ignorance, and the Extravagancies of their
Passions? What House is there in those Cities which <i>Erasmus</i>
extols, wherein all the Inhabitants profess and follow the same Way of
spiritual Salvation? When the Father is a <i>Calvinist</i>, the Mother
is often a <i>Huguenot</i>, the Son a <i>Lutheran</i>, the Servant a
<i>Hussite</i>, and the Daughter a <i>Protestant</i>. All the Family is
divided, or rather every particular Person&rsquo;s Soul is so, and at
best doubts of all. Wherein does this differ from Atheism? It is
positive Atheism. This Division, unworthy of wild Beasts, is the
Occasion, and a Sort of Mathematical Necessity, that these People
cannot be united among themselves in true Peace. For those Things are
the same to one <span class="marginnote"><i>See the latter part of the
Preface.</i></span> another, that they are to a Third; so that almost
all these having different Notions, as to God, they cannot of Necessity
be united among themselves, as differing in the most essential Part,
which is the having an uniform Notion of God in Religion. Let no Man
believe, that because they are not at War among themselves, it is Love
that is the Occasion of it. The Ground of their false Tranquility is to
be call&rsquo;d a Cessation, and not Peace. These are the People who
have unhing&rsquo;d Loyalty and the Christian Religion, before settled
in the Islands, and remotest Parts of <i>Asia</i>, making Excursions
from their own Country, as far as <i>China</i>, their raging Avarice
being grounded on the Advice given them by the Queen of <i>England</i>,
and on Malice, because King <i>Philip</i> the IId had shut up the other
Ports of his Kingdoms against them; so to endeavour to reduce them

<p><span class="marginnote">Dutch <i>first sail to the</i>
Moluccos.</span> The first <i>Dutch</i> Fleet that came to the
<i>Molucco</i> Islands, after the <i>English</i>, in the Year 1598,
shall be here spoken of. Some prime Men, for the Sake of their Country,
as they said, and to gain Reputation, met in <i>Holland</i> and
<i>Zealand</i>, and fitted out six Ships and two Brigantines, to sail
into <i>India</i>. The first Ship they call&rsquo;d the <i>Maurice</i>,
the Admiral in her being <i>Jacob Cornelius Neck</i>, born at
<i>Roterdam</i>, and the Master <i>Gonaert Jansk</i>; the second was
the <i>Amsterdam</i>, and in her the Vice-Admiral <i>Vibrant
Darkik</i>; the other Ships were the <i>Holland</i>, the
<i>Zealand</i>, the <i>Guelder</i>, and the <i>Utrecht</i>; The bigger
Brigantine the <i>Friezland</i>, and the smaller the <i>Overissel</i>.
They carry&rsquo;d 160 Soldiers, besides Mariners, and saild from
<i>Roterdam</i> on the 13th of <i>March</i>. Off from <i>Sluys</i>, on
the 4th of <i>April</i>, they had such a dreadful Storm, as might have
discourag&rsquo;d them from Proceeding, and the Ship the <i>Holland</i>
was almost disabled; but still they were drove on by the Weather to the
<i>Texel</i>, and thence to <i>Debenter</i>, and in Conclusion they got
into the Ocean. They met another Ship returning to the <i>Low
Countries</i>, which presented them with 10000 Oranges, and having
distributed them among the Men, they made a general Rejoycing, for the
baptizing of 25 Men, aboard the Ship the <i>Guelder</i>, on the 10th of
<i>May</i>. <span class="marginnote">Barrels <i>must be a
Mistake</i>.</span> On the 11th they anchor&rsquo;d at <i>Barrels</i>,
and on the 15th at the Island <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157"
href="#pb157" name="pb157">157</a>]</span><i>Madera</i>, and again on
the 17th at the <i>Canaries</i>, <i>Gomera</i>, and <i>Palma</i>,
passing by those of <i>Sal</i> and <i>Santiago</i>, which are those of
<i>Cabo Verde</i>, they furl&rsquo;d all their Sails, and drove in a
Storm, in 29 Degrees Latitude. On the first of <i>June</i> they took a
Sea Tortoise which weigh&rsquo;d 143 Pounds. On the 15th of the same
Month, <i>Gerrit Jans</i>, either provok&rsquo;d by Wine or a worse
Spirit, cast himself into the Sea, from the highest Part of the greater
Brigantine. The next Day, aboard the Ship <i>Guelder</i>, in which the
new baptised Men were, they saw a large flying-Fish, which clapping too
its Wings, Fell into the said Ship; but they saw the same Sort of
Fishes fall upon their Vessels at other Times. On the Eighth they
cross&rsquo;d the Line, and began to distribute a Pot of Wine to every
six Men; but on the 25th of the same Month, for Joy of having
pass&rsquo;d the Ridges of Rocks before <i>Brazil</i>, which run to the
Southward in 18 Degrees of South Latitude, they allow&rsquo;d three
Pots to every seven Men. Such a thick Fog fell that they lost Sight of
the smaller Brigantine; the <i>Zealand</i> soon found her again, and
discover&rsquo;d many Cranes standing on the Tops of the Reeds, or
Canes, that grew out Tall and of an equal Height above the Water. On
the 24th of <i>July</i>, they came to an Anchor at the Cape of <i>Good
Hope</i>, whence they sail&rsquo;d again on the 15th of <i>August</i>
with Stormy Weather, all the eight Vessels together, the Sea there
boiling up as a Pot does upon <span class="marginnote"><i>The Sea seems
to boil up.</i></span> the Fire. This Motion, like boiling, was seen
for about a Musket Shot in Length, and the Breadth of a Ship, and all
this Space was cover&rsquo;d thick with Weeds, which they pass&rsquo;d
over by main Force, without any Danger.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Madagascar.</span> On the 24th they
reach&rsquo;d the Island of <i>Madagascar</i>, or of <i>S.
Laurence</i>, and saw abundance of Whales. Here the plentiful
Distribution of Wine ceas&rsquo;d, and it began to be given out more
sparingly, to lament by this Abstinence, the Death of <i>John
Pomer</i>, a skilful Sailor. On the 27th they pass&rsquo;d Cape <i>S.
Sebastian</i>, and on the 30th Cape <i>S. Julian</i>. On the 4th of
<i>September</i>, it was debated whether they should make for the
Island of <i>Banda</i>, or put into the Bay of <i>Anton Gill</i>. They
came to no Resolution at that Time, tho&rsquo; they afterwards
arriv&rsquo;d separately at <i>Banda</i>, and at several Times. On the
17th they discover&rsquo;d, at a great Distance, the Island of
<i>Cerne</i>, by others call&rsquo;d the <i>Isle of Swans</i>, which is
high and mountainous, and for Joy of the Water they expected to take in
there, they gave every Man three Cups of Wine. Before that, the
Vice-Admiral went ashore with five Men, in another little Island, and
taking a View of it, found a Noble Spacious Harbour, well
land-lock&rsquo;d, into which a Rivulet of fresh <span class=
"marginnote"><i>They land in a small Island.</i></span> Water fell.
They put in and refitted their shatter&rsquo;d Vessels, finding 14
Fathom Water. They had not Landed in four Months, and therefore in
Thanksgiving, and because it was then Fair Time in <i>Holland</i>, they
made a Sort of Chappel; on the Bodies of Trees, and covering it with
Leaves, preach&rsquo;d there twice a Day, in Honour of the Fair. They
eat Abundance of Fowl, which they could almost take with their Hands,
and drank Wine more plentifully. A Native of <i>Madagascar</i>, who
came along with them, and had been taken in a former Voyage, was, by
the Instruction of those Sermons, made a Christian, and baptiz&rsquo;d,
taking the Name of <i>Laurence</i>. They found no Inhabitants in the
Island though it was Delightful. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158"
href="#pb158" name="pb158">158</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Clear Water in the Sea.</i></span> On
the 28th and 29th, they observ&rsquo;d they were upon a very
Christalline Water, without any other Tokens of their being near Land,
and those same Days at Noon, they had the Sun in the <i>Zenith</i>,
directly over their Heads, which had happen&rsquo;d to them at other
Times. Here a Storm separated the Ships; the <i>Maurice</i>, which was
Admiral, by them in <i>Latin</i> call&rsquo;d <i>Pr&aelig;toria</i>,
the <i>Holland</i>, and the <i>Overissel</i>, tho&rsquo; they
endeavour&rsquo;d to <span class="marginnote">Cerne
<i>Island.</i></span> make <i>Java</i>, were drove by Stress of Weather
to <i>Banda</i>; and the other five to the Island <i>Cerne</i>, or of
<i>Swans</i>, leaving six other smaller on the Right Hand. They
enter&rsquo;d the Port with ten Fathom Water, between two Mountains,
which contract the Mouth of it. The Situation of it is in 21 Degrees of
South Latitude, and is five Leagues in Compass. The Port is Spacious
enough to contain 50 Ships, and shelter&rsquo;d against all Winds. They
were so well pleas&rsquo;d with the Island, that they chang&rsquo;d its
ancient Name of <i>Cerne</i>, or of <i>Swans</i>, for that of
<i>Maurice</i>, in Honour of Count <i>Maurice</i> of <i>Nassau</i>,
Bastard Son to the Prince of <i>Orange</i>, so well known in our Days.
Discoverers were sent about it, and return&rsquo;d without finding any
humane Track, nor Signs of any Habitation. They had a doubtful
<span class="marginnote"><i>Tame Birds and Beasts.</i></span> Proof
hereof in the Birds and Beasts; for they ran into their Hands and
alighted on their Heads, as they might have done on the Branches of
Trees, or had they been bred Tame; which Boldness proceeded either from
their having never seen Men, or being grown very familiar with them.
<span class="marginnote"><i>Strange Bats.</i></span> Among the rest,
there are Bats, which have Heads as big, and like Apes, and these sleep
considerable Numbers of them together, and hanging on the Trees, with
their Legs and Wings extended. The Air and Soil are so healthy and fit
to be inhabited, that as soon as the Sick were landed, they recovered.
The Land is high and mountainous, full of Woods, and not being
inhabited, there are no Tracts or Paths through them. There
<span class="marginnote"><i>Ebony<span class="corr" id="xd21e18439"
title="Not in source">.</span></i></span> is an infinite Quantity of
Ebony Trees, as black as Pitch, and as smooth as Ivory; the Trunks
being cover&rsquo;d with a rough Bark, preserve the Body solid. There
are other Plants, whose Trunks are Red, and others Pale as Wax;
delicious Coco-Nuts, vast Numbers of Palm-Trees, and some of them of
such Sort, that one of their Leaves covers all a Man&rsquo;s Body, and
defends it against the Rain. They spread their Nets, and among the
other <span class="marginnote"><i>Monstrous Thornback.</i></span>
Multitude of Fishes, took a Thornback so large, that it afforded two
Meals <span class="marginnote"><i>Tortoises.</i></span> for all the Men
in the Ships. They saw Land Tortoises, so big, that one of them
walk&rsquo;d with four Soldiers sitting on its Back; and ten of them
din&rsquo;d upon the Shell of another, as if it had been a round Table.
In a very short Time they kill&rsquo;d Abundance of Turtle-Doves, and
another Sort of <span class="marginnote"><i>Penguins.</i></span> white
Birds, bigger than our Swans, but as round as a Ball, and have only two
or three curl&rsquo;d Feathers in the Tail. There were so many blew
Parrots, that they might have loaded their Ships with them.
<i>Indian</i> Crows, twice as big as the <i>European</i>, of three
several colour&rsquo;d Feathers.</p>
<p>They erected Forges, dress&rsquo;d all their Tools, and built
another Vessel, to supply the Place of the <i>Utrecht</i>, which with
the other two, had directed her Course for <i>Madagascar</i>. They
again took a View of their <i>Maurice</i> Island, and towards the
Inland Part of it, tho&rsquo; there were no Signs of any <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Wax found with</i> Greek <i>Characters.</i></span>
humane Habitation, found about three hundred Pounds weight of Wax, on
which there were plain <i>Greek</i> Letters and Characters. They also
saw Oars, Nets, and Pieces of Timber, being the Wreck of Ships. The
Vice-Admiral, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name=
"pb159">159</a>]</span>providing a smooth square Board, carv&rsquo;d on
it the Arms of <i>Holland</i>, <i>Zealand</i>, and <i>Amsterdam</i>,
and nail&rsquo;d it on the Top of a Tree, as a Memorial of his being
there, and giving the Name of <span class="ex"><i>MAURICE</i></span> to
the island, with this Inscription, which being in <i>Spanish</i>,
denotes their Hatred to the Ancient Faith of our Nation, and being
couch&rsquo;d in one Line over their Arms, was, <span class="ex"><i>THE
REFORM&rsquo;D CHRISTIANS</i></span>. Then they plow&rsquo;d up a large
Field, and sow&rsquo;d it with Wheat, and other <i>European</i> Grain;
turning lose some Hens, to see what Improvement they should find
another Time. They again, for some Days, visited the Hills and Plains,
and found no Track of Man.</p>
<p>Whilst these refresh&rsquo;d themselves at the Island <i>Cerne</i>,
or of <i>Swans</i>, being fourteen Days, the other three Ships
arriv&rsquo;d at <i>S. Mary</i>&rsquo;s, a barren Island, <span class=
"marginnote">S. Mary <i>Island</i>.</span> tho&rsquo; some Orange and
Lemon Trees grow in it, as also Sugar Canes, and there are Hens. About
it, and in Sight of Land, there are monstrous Whales. They landed, but
not without Opposition from the Natives, with whom they fought, and
took their King; but he was easily ransom&rsquo;d, a <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Strange Ransom for a King.</i></span> Cow and a Calf
being given them in Exchange for him. They saw the Manner of the Whale
Fishery, which is very easy there. The <i>Indians</i> make up close to
them in their Canoes, and stick them with a Harping-Iron they dart,
being ty&rsquo;d to Ropes made of the Barks of Trees. They stor&rsquo;d
their Ship with their Flesh and Oil, and some Oranges, and went over to
the Bay of <i>Anton Gil</i>, where the <i>Madagascar Indian</i>, would
not stay, as he had desired before, being now well affected to the
Habit and Drunkenness of his Companions. They were toss&rsquo;d
backwards and forwards for five Days, between certain Islands,
destitute of Provisions, and unsafe, by Reason they were in War among
themselves.</p>
<p>They set forward with a fair Gale towards <i>Java</i>, and on the
26th of <i>December</i>, 1598, arriv&rsquo;d at <i>Banda</i>, which is
eight Leagues from <i>Amboina</i>. <span class="marginnote">Banda
<i>Island</i>.</span> This Island is shap&rsquo;d like a Horse-shooe,
and lies in four Degrees of South Latitude. It is most fruitful, with
little or no Improvement, in Nutmegs, and their precious Mace; as also
Provisions and Medicines for Men, beyond all other Parts of the known
World. It is divided into three Parts, each of them three Leagues in
Compass. The Capital City is called <i>Nera</i>. As soon as they
arriv&rsquo;d, they contracted Friendship with the Islanders;
tho&rsquo; a foreign Ship, to secure the Trade to herself, gave them to
understand, that the <i>Dutch</i> were certain Pirates who fled the
Year before, and had lain conceal&rsquo;d at Sea, to come again and rob
the Island, and therefore they did not fully credit them. This Notion
was back&rsquo;d by Trading <i>Portugueses</i>, and others settled
there; but the <i>Dutch</i> sending their <i>Abdol</i>, that is the
<i>Indian</i> Interpreter, with some Soldiers, and Gifts to present the
King, according to the Custom of Merchants that come into his Country,
they before him clear&rsquo;d that Imputation, and defended their
Innocence. The King was an Infant, and govern&rsquo;d by his
<i>Cephates</i>, that <span class="marginnote"><i>The</i> Dutch
<i>settle Trade there</i>.</span> is his Vice-Roy, Tutor, or Protector,
who set all right. They gave the King the Present before him, which he
receiv&rsquo;d very graciously. It consisted of certain valuable gilt
Vessels, admirably ingrav&rsquo;d, Christal Glasses, Looking-Glasses in
gilt Frames, and Pieces of Velvet and Taffety. They deliver&rsquo;d him
Letters and Commissions of the States of <i>Holland</i>,
<i>Zealand</i>, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160"
name="pb160">160</a>]</span>and Count <i>Maurice</i>, with their Seals
hanging to them in Form. All was accepted, and they lay down flat on
the Ground to receive and read the Letters, with profound Reverence.
The King promis&rsquo;d to answer them, as he did, and immediately gave
leave to Trade; whereupon the <i>Dutch</i> built Factories in the
Island. They then expos&rsquo;d in publick Shops great Store of Arms,
Silks, Linnen and Cloth; as did the Natives their Spice, <i>China</i>
Ware, and Pearls, and other Commodities the Neighbouring Islanders and
<i>Chineses</i> bring hither to barter, and sell to one another. Five
<span class="marginnote"><i>All their Ships meet again.</i></span>
Weeks after, the other three Ships <span class="corr" id="xd21e18617"
title="Source: arrriv&rsquo;d">arriv&rsquo;d</span>, and the people of
the City hearing the Discharges of the Cannon, and seeing the Auncients
spread abroad, for Joy of the Ships meeting again, came down to the
Port, and encompass&rsquo;d the Ships in Boats, offering them Plenty of
Fowl, Eggs, Coco Nuts, Bananas, Sugar-Canes, and Cakes made of
Rice-Flower. This dainty Feeding continu&rsquo;d every Day, and they
gave them a Weeks Provision for a <i>Dutch</i> Man for one Pewter
Spoon. However they rais&rsquo;d the Price of Pepper; but they
pay&rsquo;d for all with Pins and Needles, Knives, Spoons,
Looking-Glasses, and little Tabors; and with those same Commodities,
they purchas&rsquo;d more valuable Goods at <i>Sumatra</i>, as also
Provisions; when four of these eight Ships return&rsquo;d Homewards,
the others sailing for <i>Ternate</i> and the <i>Moluccos</i>.</p>
<p>The greatest Quantity, and best Commodity they took in here, was of
<span class="marginnote"><i>The Nutmeg Tree.</i></span> are few and
weak; but in <i>Banda</i> there is a plentiful Crop, and they have much
more Virtue. Nature has cloath&rsquo;d its Mountains and Plains, with
Woods and Groves of these Plants. They are like the <i>European</i>
Pear-Trees, and their Fruit resembles Pairs, or rather in Roundness the
<i>Melocotones</i>. When the Nutmegs blosom, they spread a cordial
Fragrancy; by degrees they lose their Native Green, which is original
in all Vegetables; and then succeeds a Blew, intermix&rsquo;d with
Grey, Cherry-Colour, and a pale Gold Colour, as we see in the Rainbow,
tho&rsquo; not in that regular Division, but in Spots like the Jaspar
Stone. Infinite Numbers of Parrots, and other birds of various Plumage,
most delightful to behold, come to sit upon the Branches, attracted by
the sweet Odour. The Nuts, when dry, cast off the Shell it grows
cover&rsquo;d with, and is the Mace, within which is a white Kernel,
not so sharp in Taste as the Nut, and when dry is converted into its
Substance. Of this Mace, which is hot and dry in the second Degree, and
within the third, the <i>Bandeses</i> make a most <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Oil of Nutmeg.</i></span> precious Oil to cure all
Distempers in the Nerves, and Aches caus&rsquo;d by cold. Of these Nuts
they choose the freshest, weightiest, fattest, juiciest, <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Virtues of Nutmeg.</i></span> and without any Hole.
With them they cure, or correct stinking Breath, clear the Eyes,
comfort the Stomach, Liver, and Spleen, and digest Meat. They are a
Remedy against many other Distempers, and serve to add outward Lustre
to the Face. The <i>Bandeses</i> call the Mace of their Aromatick Nuts,
<i>Buna Pala</i>. It was not known to the <i>Greeks</i> nor to
<i>Pliny</i>, according to <i>Averrois</i>; tho&rsquo; <i>Serapion</i>,
whether the true, or the suppositious, when he describes it, alledges
<i>Gallen</i>&rsquo;s Authority. It is true, the <i>Chrisabolans</i> he
treated of, agree well enough with the Nutmegs in Colour and Shape.

<p>The <i>Javaneses</i>, <i>Chineses</i>, and Natives of the
<i>Moluccos</i> resort to the City <i>Mora</i>, to barter for this
precious Fruit, and load their Ships with it; and <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Merchants way of living at</i> Banda.</span> this is
the Trade of that People, as is that of Clove to <i>Ternate</i>,
<i>Tydore</i>, and the other <i>Moluccos</i>. The Merchants arriving in
this Island, many of them contribute to make up a Sum, wherewith they
purchase a Woman, to dress their Meat, and attend them. The
<i>Dutch</i> did so from this first Time. When they go away she is left
Free, till they return the next Year; so that her Slavery commences
with the Return of her Masters, and their Absence gives it an
Intermission. Some of the Natives are Idolaters; but the <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e18718" title="Source: great-ter">greater</span> Part
<i>Mahometans</i>, and so superstitious, that the very Soldiers do not
mount the Guard, till they have pray&rsquo;d in the Mosques, so loud,
that all <span class="marginnote"><i>Religion of</i> Banda.</span> the
Neighbourhood can hear them. Nor must any Man go into them without
washing his Feet, in great Vessels of Water, provided at the Door, by
the publick. Their Prayers consist in these Words, <i>Estagfer
Ai&rsquo;lah Estagfer Al&rsquo;lah, Asgiv&rsquo;d Ai&rsquo;lahe,
Asgiv&rsquo;d Al&rsquo;lahe, La Il&rsquo;lahe Inla Ai&rsquo;lah,
Mu.amed resul At&rsquo;lahi</i>. When they utter these last Words, they
stroke their Faces with their Hands, a Ceremony denoting much Devotion.
The Words in <i>English</i> are; Pardon O God, Pardon O God. I
prostrate my self to God. I prostrate my self to God. There is no other
God but God, and <i>Mahomet</i> his Messenger: By these Words, There is
no other God but God, they deny the eneffable Mystery of the most
blessed Trinity. Then they proceed to several Blasphemies. They say
other Prayers, at which they scarce move their lips; when they do this
they stand three and three upon a Mat, lifting up their Eyes to Heaven
three Times, and bowing down their Heads to the Ground. The
<i>Dutch</i> Author, who gives this Account, does not mention any other
Religion in this Island, nor in any of the others their Fleets
touch&rsquo;d at; tho&rsquo; it is so well known, that the Catholick
Faith of our Lord <i>Jesus Christ</i> has been preach&rsquo;d many
Years before, throughout them all, with the Glory of Martyrdom; but
those People conceal it, to what Intent is well known.</p>
<p>The <i>Banaeses</i> assemble in the Streets, and publick Places,
where they feast <span class="marginnote"><i>Feasting in
Banda.</i></span> themselves. It is frequent among them to eat in the
Temples and Woods, an hundred in a Parcel; especially when they consult
together about the publick Weal, or any Danger. There are seven Cities
in the Island, which are Enemies to one another. <i>Nera</i> is averse
to the <i>Lambethans</i>, <i>Combers</i> and <i>Veierans</i>, and
maintains Friendship with the Inhabitants of <i>Lontoor</i>, which is
on the other Side of the Island, and those of two other little Cities
call&rsquo;d <i>Poleruija</i> and <i>Poelvay</i>. When they are to
fight, they always repair <span class="marginnote"><i>Enmity among
their Cities.</i></span> first to <i>Nera</i>, to concert Affairs.
<i>Banda</i> provides their Entertainments on the Ground, in the
Streets. The Dishes are made of the Trunks and Leaves of
<i>Bananas</i>, and other Plants. Every one has a Piece of <i>Sagu</i>
brought him on them, and a Plate of Rice boil&rsquo;d in the Broth of
Flesh. This they devour, carrying it to their Mouths with both Hands,
and eat it with such a Relish, as if they had <i>Jove</i>&rsquo;s
Brains dress&rsquo;d set before them; so the <i>Dutch</i> Relation of
<i>Paludanus</i> and <i>Hugo</i> expresses it. Whilst the Meat lasts,
till the Multitude are satisfy&rsquo;d, the Nobles by two and two, take
up their Cymiters and Shields, and fight to the sound of Bells, and the
Clattering of their Basons. When weary of this Exercise, they deliver
the Weapons to others, which continue it. The Cause of their Wars,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name=
"pb162">162</a>]</span>is for that the Inhabitants of <i>Labetaca</i>,
many Years since, set some Plants in the Territory of <i>Nera</i>. The
People of this City affronted at this Presumption, made the first War
upon them; which is as bloodily prosecuted as if their Religion, or
Honour, depended on it. They attack one another by Day and Night in
their Territories, and by Sea in their <i>Carcoas</i>.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Banda <i>Tar</i>.</span> In these they do
not, like us, fill up the Seams of the Boards with Pitch and Tar, but
with Shells of <i>Indian</i> Nuts, which they call <i>Clappos</i>. They
pound those Shells and Rhinds, till they became like a Bitumen, or
Mass, wherein there remain certain Threads, which resemble Hemp, with
this they knit their Seams, and fill up the Crannyes and cover them in
such Sort that it resists the Force of the Water. They carry two, and
sometimes four Pieces of Cannon. The Men use small Fire-locks,
Bucklers, and <span class="marginnote"><i>Their Weapons.</i></span>
large Cymiters, which they call <i>Padang</i>, and Lances of a more
solid Wood than our Box. They exercise all these Weapons from their
Child-hood, as they do in casting a sort of Hooks with sharp Points and
Edges, which they dart at the Enemies Bodies, and then draw back the
Lines they are made fast to. Their Heads they arm with Helmets; and on
their Crests wear Birds of Paradise, both for Ornament, and a
superstitious Defence. They have Breast and Back Pieces, and
call&rsquo;d them as we did Corselets. When they are to fight at Sea,
as soon as the War-like Instruments begin to sound, the Soldiers fall a
leaping, and skipping on the Benches, which run round the <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Oars like Shovels.</i></span> <i>Carcoas</i> from Stem
to Stern. The Slaves ply the Oars, which are like wooden Shovels, make
the Vessel fly by main Force, and serve to lade out the Water, when
there is Occasion. They are so revengeful, that having <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Cruelty of</i> Bandeses.</span> been in those Days
vanquish&rsquo;d on Land by the <i>Labetans</i>, many of them being
kill&rsquo;d and wounded, those of <i>Nera</i> assembled the next Day
in five <i>Carcoas</i>, and attacking the little Island <i>Bayjer</i>,
the Natives whereof had assisted the <i>Labetans</i> they slew all they
found, without sparing any but a few Women, whom they carry&rsquo;d
Captives to <i>Nera</i>, with the Heads of their Enemies before them on
Spears; and for four Days, to the Amazement of <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e18869" title="Source: For-reigners">Foreigners</span>, and
particularly the <i>Dutch</i>, they show&rsquo;d their Cymiters
embrew&rsquo;d in Gore, about the Streets. Nay, a Soldier among them,
in the Sight of Abundance, took a Fancy to try his Cymiter, he
carry&rsquo;d naked, and with it clove down one of the Captive Women,
from the Shoulder to the Breast.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Burial of Enemies.</i></span> They
shew&rsquo;d themselves Merciful in burying those Heads, assembling
together in the House of the <i>Shabander</i>, that is the Governor, in
the Presence of all the People, which uses to meet to see such
Spectacles, every <span class="marginnote"><i>Heads.</i></span>Soldier,
as a Testimony of his Valour, laid all the Heads he had cut off on
<span class="marginnote"><i>Their Funerals.</i></span> a very large
Stone, under a Tree: They wrapp&rsquo;d them up in Cotton Cloths, and
carrying them in Dishes bury&rsquo;d them in a Grove, with much Smoke
of Frankincense, whereof they have great Plenty. Had those dead Persons
been Natives, their Kindred and Friends would have come immediately to
lament with loud Cries, as they use to do, over their Graves, which
they dig like us, wrap up the Bodies in Shrouds of white Cotton, and
carry them to be bury&rsquo;d on their Shoulders. They are great
Observers, that the Funerals of Men should go before those of Women;
place Lamps over the Graves of all, and by their Light pray for them.
They cry out furiously, calling the Dead, as if they hop&rsquo;d they
should come to Life at their Call; and perceiving they do not rise
again, the Kindred and Friends meet about <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb163" href="#pb163" name="pb163">163</a>]</span>the most splendid
Entertainment they are able to provide. Being ask&rsquo;d by the
<i>Dutch</i>, what it was they ask&rsquo;d of God in the Prayers they
mutter&rsquo;d over the Graves, they answer&rsquo;d. <i>We pray that
the Dead may not rise again.</i> So that the Want of the true Light of
Faith, does not hinder them from seeing, how much Mankind suffers from
the first Moment of his Life, till the last; but it is rather to be
concluded, that they look upon it as a Misfortune to have been born.
They were much amaz&rsquo;d to hear, that the <i>Dutch</i> did not use
the same Ceremony towards their dead.</p>
<p>They play at Foot-Ball, which is made of <i>Spanish</i> Reeds. They
that <span class="marginnote"><i>Foot-Ball.</i></span> Play make a Ring
one standing in the Center, who tosses the Ball to those about him, and
they with a Kick throw it so high that it is almost out of Sight. If
any one misses it, they hiss, and hoot, to shame him for his
Unskilfulness. Men live in this Island longer than in any other Parts
of <span class="marginnote"><i>Life long in</i> Banda.</span> the
World. The <i>Dutch</i> saw several, who exceed 130 Years of Age. They
live upon the Product of their Country; and tho&rsquo; there is
continual War, yet the greater Number lives Idle; and it is very
remarkable that those People, who are so much addicted to Sloath,
should be such Enemies to Quietness. A useless Life does not deserve
much Age; and that which is dedicated to Idleness seldom attains to it.
The Women Plow and Till <span class="marginnote"><i>Women Till the
Land.</i></span> the Land, and follow other manly Professions. They
seldom go abroad with Men; they have all the Charge of Houshold
Affairs, and their greatest Employment within Doors, is usually
uncasing and drying of Nutmegs.</p>
<p>The <i>Dutch</i> having loaded with Spice, Purcelane, and some
Rubies, and <span class="marginnote">Dutch <i>depart from</i>
Banda.</span> settled Factories, and Amity, sail&rsquo;d from
<i>Banda</i>, on the 14th of <i>July</i>, with great firing of Cannon.
They stood towards the Island <i>Noeselau</i>, the Natives whereof are
<i>Anthropophagi</i>, so the <i>Greeks</i> call Man-Eaters. They
proceeded towards that of <i>Amboyna</i>, whose Western Point they
discover&rsquo;d, yet did not touch at it then, but went on to the
greater <i>Java</i>, notwithstanding <span class="marginnote"><i>Come
to</i> Java.</span> their Admiral was at <i>Amboyna</i>. They
arriv&rsquo;d at <i>Java</i> and the City <i>Tuban</i>, sent two Boats
thither to Discover, and know whither they might be allow&rsquo;d to
take in Provisions. Those who return&rsquo;d with the Answer, brought
along with them a <i>Portuguese</i>, who, at the Perswasion of the
Natives, had renounc&rsquo;d <span class="marginnote">Portuguese
<i>Renegado</i>.</span> the Faith of <i>Jesus Christ</i>, as was known,
and call&rsquo;d among them by the name of the <i>Renegado</i>, as a
proper Appellative, and not dishonourable. This Man inform&rsquo;d the
Admiral, That if he would stay there three or four Months, he might
enrich his Ships to his Hearts Content. They sent by him to ask the
King&rsquo;s Leave, with some Presents of Copper, Glass and Silk.
<span class="marginnote"><i>Presents to and from the King.</i></span>
The next day Merchants came down to the Harbour, with Abundance of
Commodities; and from the King, in Return for their insignificant
Present, they brought the <i>Dutch</i> 19 great Sacks of Rice. The
Trade being settled, they went up to the City, where they saw several
Horsemen, well Arm&rsquo;d, Horses well Accouter&rsquo;d, on which they
value themselves very much, Shops well stor&rsquo;d, and a free Trade
for all Nations. The Vice-Admiral went to kiss the King&rsquo;s Hand,
who receiv&rsquo;d him Graciously; promis&rsquo;d to go Aboard the
Ships in Person, and perform&rsquo;d it, having first order&rsquo;d
them to be show&rsquo;d all his Royal Apartments, even to his Womens
private Lodgings; his Elephants; an infinite number of Birds in Cages,
and his Stables full of excellent Horses, and many of them. Then the
Prince came Aboare the Ships, and after him the King. The Cannon
saluted them both, and they admir&rsquo;d, and were pleas&rsquo;d with
the Noise. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name=

<p><span class="marginnote">Tuban <i>Capital of</i> Java.</span>
<i>Tuban</i> is the King of <i>Java</i>&rsquo;s Court, the strongest of
all the Cities in that Island, encompass&rsquo;d with a high Wall,
divided by several Gates with Towers on them, contains stately
Structures, and Squares appointed for the publick Resort of Traders,
the King is extraordinary rich, and in a few Hours can gather a great
Number of Horse and Foot. His Palace is truly Royal, his Family
consists of the Prime Nobility, and he is very powerful at Sea. They
call their Ships Juncks; which being loaded with Pepper, and other
Product of the Country, as Silks and Cloths, the Manufactures
<span class="marginnote"><i>Trade of that City.</i></span> of his
People, are sent to <i>Balim</i>; where bartering them for Cloaths,
they transport those to other Kingdoms, as those of <i>Banda</i>, the
<i>Moluccos</i>, and <i>Philippines</i>. Whence, and from other
Islands, having improv&rsquo;d their Commodities, they bring Mastick,
Nutmegs, Cloves, and other Spice. All the <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Habit.</i></span> Country abounds in Cattle, which
graze all Day in the Woods, and are hous&rsquo;d at Night. Their Habit
is the same as at <i>Banda</i>, and covers their Bodies from the Waste
downwards, the rest upwards remaining naked. They all wear Daggers,
call&rsquo;d <i>Crises</i>, and the Nobles stately long Vests, the
Fullness whereof waves in the Air magnificently. None of them goes
abroad attended by less than ten or twelve Servants, one of which
always carries for his Master a little Basket full of the Leaves of a
certain Plant they call <i>Betele</i>, which they chew with green Nuts,
and a little Lime. This Composition they call <i>Ledon</i>; in chewing,
it yields a Juice, which they swallow, and then spit out the green
Substance, after the Virtue has been extracted in their Mouths.</p>
<p>They were so overjoy&rsquo;d at the coming of the <i>Dutch</i>, that
the next Day <span class="marginnote"><i>The Kings Dress.</i></span>
they invited them to see their Diversions. The King was present a
Horse-Back, clad in several Sorts of rich Silks, but all Girt about
him. To his Belt hung a Cymiter, in a Scabard adorn&rsquo;d with
precious Stones; the Hilt of beaten Gold, with a Devils Head
form&rsquo;d on it. On his Turbant he had abundance of Feathers. All
the Nobility follow&rsquo;d him, Dress&rsquo;d much after the same
manner, mounted on stately prancing Horses, but smaller than ours, with
rich Furnitures of <i>Spanish</i> Leather, studded, and plated with
Gold, and Figures of Serpents; and in some of the Bridles they had
Stones, so white that they look&rsquo;d like Alabaster. Sometimes they
ran streight forwards, and sometimes in a Ring, casting their Darts.
When the Sport was over, they attended the King, by whose Orders they
carry&rsquo;d aboard the Ships, <span class="marginnote"><i>Commerce
settled between the</i> Dutch <i>and</i> Javaneses.</span> and to the
<i>Dutch</i> Men&rsquo;s Lodgings, a great quantity of Rice, Sheep,
Goats, Hens, Eggs, Fish, and Fruit, as Coco-Nuts, Mangos, Lemons, and
delicious Bananas. Then they fell to treating of Trade, and Amity, and
thought every Thing cheap except the Pepper, for they not liking the
Commodities the <i>Dutch</i> offer&rsquo;d in Exchange for it, lifting
up their Hands cry&rsquo;d, <i>Lima</i>, which, in their Tongue,
signifies five Pieces of Eight. So much they demanded for a Measure of
theirs. They were well receiv&rsquo;d in all Respects, except in
Relation to admitting of their Sect.</p>
<p>They had deliver&rsquo;d Letters to the King from Count
<i>Maurice</i>, which he answer&rsquo;d in the <i>Persian</i> Tongue,
and the <i>Dutch</i> having receiv&rsquo;d them, left <i>Tuban</i>, on
the 24th of the same Month, with fair Weather, and well furnish&rsquo;d
with valuable Commodities and Provisions. Passing by the Island
<span class="marginnote">Madura <i>Island</i>.</span> <i>Sidago</i>,
they anchor&rsquo;d between <i>Java</i> and <i>Madura</i>; sounded the
Depth, and notwithstanding the Current, and that the Ground was a stiff
Muddy Hill, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name=
"pb165">165</a>]</span>they visited <i>Madura</i>, landing on the
East-side; but remov&rsquo;d presently to the City <i>Arosbay</i>, on
the West, and afterwards thence to <i>Jorta</i>, to get Guides, or
Pilots to conduct them to the rest of the <i>Moluccos</i>. They sent to
Compliment the King of <i>Madura</i>, who presently after the Audience,
sent the Vice-Admiral a Sheep, with which went the Renegado, who had
brought him a Dagger, they call <i>Criz</i>, from the King of
<i>Tuban</i>, richly adorn&rsquo;d with Gold and precious Stones, and
the King&rsquo;s Head engrav&rsquo;d on the Pommel. They found a
<i>German</i> settled in the Country, rich in Spice, and understood
<span class="marginnote">Madura <i>Described.</i></span> by him, that
at <i>Arosbay</i> they had seiz&rsquo;d 40 of their Companions. The
Island of <i>Madura</i>, next to <i>Java</i>, inclines to the
Northward. They wear the same Habit as in the other; but are sharper
Witted. It is most fruitful in Rice, but both in Reaping and Plowing,
the Peasants and Buffalos are mir&rsquo;d up to the Knees, the
continual Inundations keeping the Ground so wet. Few Ships come to it,
by reason of its inaccessible Shoales. They have the same common use of
Weapons, Elephants, Horses, Spears, Campilanes, or Cymiters, and
Shields. The <i>Crizes</i>, or Daggers, worn by the King&rsquo;s Guards
are <span class="marginnote">Arosbay <i>City.</i></span> of Silver. The
City <i>Arosbay</i> is Populous, and well Wall&rsquo;d. The
<i>Hollanders</i> main Design in coming to it, was, as has been said,
to take in Pilots, and other Necessaries to proceed to the
<i>Molucco</i> Islands; to which Purpose, and to avoid the Shoals lying
betwixt <i>Java</i> and <i>Madura</i>, they divided their Ships. The
Vice-Admiral, with the <i>Guelder</i> and <i>Zealand</i>, pass&rsquo;d
the Chanels of <i>Madura</i>, in order to joyn, at <i>Jorta</i>, the
Junks that sail for <i>Ternate</i>, and thence to the other
<i>Molucco</i> Islands.</p>
<p>The Admiral <i>Sticht Utrecht</i>, running along the length of
<i>Madura</i>, came to an Anchor before <i>Arosbay</i>. He sent out a
Number of his Men in the <span class="marginnote">Dutch <i>taken by the
King of</i> Madura.</span> Boat, to bring Rice, and other Provisions
from Shore. No sooner were they landed, then seiz&rsquo;d,
disarm&rsquo;d, stripp&rsquo;d, and carry&rsquo;d before the King.
Those staying long, another Boat was sent with only three Men, and the
same befell them. The Prisoners intreated the King to give leave, that
those three, or any others, might go to give the Admiral an Account. He
granted it, but upon Condition, that as soon as they had
deliver&rsquo;d the Message, they should return to Prison. They gave
Notice of their Misfortune, and the Admiral sent away a Boat to carry
immediate Advice to his Countrymen at the City <i>Jorta</i>, writing
several Letters to procure the Prisoners Liberty. The Vice-Admiral came
with his Ships, and joyn&rsquo;d those at <i>Arosbay</i>. The
<span class="marginnote"><i>His Demands for their Ransom.</i></span>
King demanded the two biggest Brass Guns aboard the Admiral, many
Pieces of Silk, and one thousand Pieces of Eight for the Ransom of the
Prisoners. The Admiral answer&rsquo;d, That the Cannon was not his own,
but belong&rsquo;d to all his Nation, and therefore he desir&rsquo;d
him to moderate the Ransom, and turn it into Money, or take it out in
such Commodities as he brought. Six Days were spent in Treating, and
the Delay made the Conclusion more Difficult; and therefore the Admiral
believing, that his Men were kept Prisoners in their own Boats, or near
the Sea, without any considerable Guard, he order&rsquo;d all his Men
to land at once, and to Rescue them <span class="marginnote"><i>Attempt
to Rescue them by Force.</i></span> by Force. An hundred and fifty
<i>Dutchmen</i> attempted it, but saw a great Number of People
gathering on the Shore, led by the <i>Portugueses</i>, who
carry&rsquo;d white Colours, in token of Peace, giving out that they
came to treat of an Accommodation, which, as <i>Hugo</i> affirms, was a
Stratagem to gain Time for the Citizens to Arm. The <i>Dutch</i> either
suspected, or had Notice <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href=
"#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span>of it, and forming a small body
with about 20 Musquetiers, contriv&rsquo;d to have their other Boats
draw nearer, that so the Seamen and Officers might come to Fight,
according to the appointed Order. More Men came out of the City, at
another Gate, to enclose them unawares in the Port. The <i>Dutch</i>
saw into the Policy, and were sensible of the Danger, and therefore
sent two other boats to guard the Port. This Precaution was the saving
of their Lives; but they could not escape a Shower of Arrows, wherewith
the <i>Arosbayans</i> thought to subdue them, not so much by their
Force, and the Harm receiv&rsquo;d, as by keeping the Enemy in Play,
that so they might spend their Powder, and be oblig&rsquo;d to retire
to their Ships. Nor would they have been safe there, for now the Wind
and Sea threatned them, and <span class="marginnote">Dutch
<i>Defeated</i>.</span> thirty six Men belonging to the Admiral, and
thirteen to the <i>Zealand</i> were Drown&rsquo;d, and the Boats cast
away. Some few escap&rsquo;d, whom they did not kill, at the Request of
the Renegado of <i>Tuban</i>, but they were made Prisoners. These
kneeling down, to move Compassion, with their dismal Looks, and Tears,
the Conquerors laid a Handful of Earth on their Heads, a Ceremony
<span class="marginnote"><i>Ceremony in giving Quarter.</i></span> they
use towards the vanquish&rsquo;d, whose Lives they grant. Perhaps they
themselves know not the Reason, and Original of the Custom. Five and
Twenty were lost in this Encounter, fifteen of the Admirals, one of
<i>John Marts</i>, and nine of the <i>Zealand</i>. The Prisoners were
carry&rsquo;d to a Country Cottage; three Men dangerously wounded, one
Trumpeter, and a Herald put into Chains, the others only their Hands
bound. The rest were carry&rsquo;d far from these, and put into a deep
Cellar. The Herald being brought into the King&rsquo;s Presence, he
ask&rsquo;d him, whether he would stay in his Country, promising, among
other Favours, that he would marry him to two of his own Wives. The
<i>Dutchman</i> answer&rsquo;d, returning Thanks, but with Freedom in
his Looks, That with his good leave he had rather return to his
Companions. He was therefore carry&rsquo;d, with the Trumpeter, about
the City, and at his going out at the Gate saw all the Prisoners, being
fifty one, who were conducting, under a Guard, to another Island.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Prisoners Ransom&rsquo;d.</i></span> In
fine, the Agreement was concluded, and the King discharg&rsquo;d them
for 2000 <i>Florines</i>. So they return&rsquo;d to their Ships, except
two, who hid themselves, taking a liking to that barbarous Way of
living. The Governour <i>Jacob Marts</i> Dy&rsquo;d, his Body was cast
into the Sea, and the rest sailing to the <span class=
"marginnote">Dutch <i>Depart.</i></span> Northward, directed their
Course for the Island of <i>Celebes</i>. They pass&rsquo;d by
<i>Combay</i>, six Leagues from it, and beyond that of <i>Routon</i>,
and escap&rsquo;d the Ridges of Rocks of <i>Cebessa</i>, which are not
mark&rsquo;d down, nor taken Notice of in Maps. Their fell mighty
Rains, and they steer&rsquo;d North East for the Island of
<i>Amboyna</i>, and in sight of <i>Boora</i>. A Boy dy&rsquo;d aboard
the <i>Zealand</i>; another falling off a Yard, into the Sea, held a
Rope&rsquo;s End in his Mouth, that his arms might be at Liberty to
swim, and quitted it not, till he had Help, and was sav&rsquo;d. The
next Day they lay by, and their Preacher made a long Spiritual
Discourse upon the Sacraments, to celebrate the solemnity of Baptizing
two Boys, whom he had already Catechis&rsquo;d. On the first of
<i>March</i>, not far from <i>Blau</i>, to the Eastward of
<i>Boora</i>, they saw three other smaller Islands, call&rsquo;d
<i>Atypoti</i>, <i>Maniba</i>, and <i>Gita</i>, which are not far from
<span class="marginnote"><i>Come to</i> Amboyna.</span> <i>Amboyna</i>.
They pass&rsquo;d by them, and arriv&rsquo;d at <i>Amboyna</i> on the
third of the same Month.</p>
<p>The Port is small, and at the Mouth of it, they were receiv&rsquo;d
by three <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=

seated on the Mountains. Thence they went on to that of <i>Ito</i>.
<i>Amboyna</i> is about eight Leagues from <i>Banda</i>, to the
Northward, in the Way to <i>Ternate</i>. The compass of it is fifteen
Leagues, most fruitful in Cloves, Oranges, Lemmons, Citrons, Coco-Nuts,
Bananas, Sugar-Canes, and other such like Product. The Natives are more
open Hearted, and sincere, than those of the <i>Moluccos</i> or
<i>Banda</i>; wear the same Habit; live Upon the Trade of Spice; are
temperate and abstemious, <span class="marginnote"><i>Their
Weapons.</i></span> and great Sufferers of Hardship. Their Weapons, are
Spears with Sharp twisted Ends; these they dart so dexterously, that
they will hit the smallest Mark at a great Distance. They also use
Cymiters and Shields, and now Muskets. They make great Masses of Sugar,
Rice, and Almonds, like our <span class="marginnote">Carcoas.</span>
Sugar-Loaves, and value themselves upon being able Seamen. Their
<i>Carcoas</i> are like great Dragons, did these swim with their Bodies
extended on the Water, and lifting up their two Ends of Head and Tail,
which are gilt, and well Carv&rsquo;d, and serve for Prow and Poop. At
both of them hang Standards of several Sorts of Silk, and Colours,
which are born up by the Wind, when they do not reach to the Water. The
Admiral of <i>Amboyna</i> came with three of these Vessels full of
arm&rsquo;d Men, to see the <i>Dutch</i>, with a <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Musick.</i></span> Noise of Kittle-Drums, and Brass
Basons hanging on the Musitian&rsquo;s Left-Shoulder, and striking them
with the Right-Hand, as they do the Tabors in <i>Spain</i>. They sang
their set Airs, understood by none but the Native <i>Amboyneses</i>,
tho&rsquo; attentively listen&rsquo;d to by the <i>Dutch</i>, for their
Strangeness. The Slaves also sang to the Noise of their Oars. They
fir&rsquo;d the three Guns every <i>Carcoa</i> carry&rsquo;d, being a
Salute, in Honour of their Guests; who relying on that Reception, dropt
their Anchors, posting many Sentinels, because they observ&rsquo;d the
Natives had done the same in all Parts, and there were constant Fires
in many Places.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Dutch <i>permitted to Trade at</i>
Amboyna.</span> The <i>Amboynese</i> Admiral ask&rsquo;d them, What
they came for, and who they were, and having heard their Answer, gave
them leave to go ashore, and expose their Commodities, allowing them
free Commerce, contrary to his Majesty&rsquo;s Prohibition, which
us&rsquo;d to be more punctually observ&rsquo;d in this Island. The
<i>Dutch</i> Vice-Admiral went ashore, where he was well received, and
conducted to a Seat cover&rsquo;d with Sails of Ships, supported by
Trees, full of Fruit not known in <i>Europe</i>. He easily
prevail&rsquo;d with the Governors, to allow him full Liberty to Trade.
Their Success was forwarded <span class="marginnote"><i>King of</i>
Ternate&rsquo;s <i>Brother assists the</i> Dutch.</span> by <i>Cachil
Azude</i>, Brother to the King of Ternate, who happen&rsquo;d to be
there then, celebrating his Nuptials, being newly come with his Bride,
who was the Daughter of a <i>Sangiack</i> of <i>Batochina</i>. He had
long courted, and desir&rsquo;d to be marry&rsquo;d to her, but was
oppos&rsquo;d by the Father, who had promised her to the King of
<i>Bachian</i>. We shall say no more of their Love, nor of what became
of the Prince, because it is no essential Part of this History. He
presently repair&rsquo;d to the <i>Dutch</i>, and order&rsquo;d them to
be furnish&rsquo;d with those Loaves made of Sugar, Almonds and Rice,
with Coco-Nuts, Bananas, and Wine made of Rice, and this so lavishly,
that the <i>Dutch</i> <span class="marginnote"><i>Plenty of
Provisions.</i></span> Relations own they had scarce Room to lay up
such Plenty of Provisions. The same would have been, had they bought
them, for they had so much for a Pewter Spoon, that they knew not what
to do with it. The <i>Amboynese</i> Admiral went aboard the Ships
again, was pleas&rsquo;d to see the great Guns, and the Variety and
Plenty of Merchandise. The Prince of <i>Ternate</i> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name="pb168">168</a>]</span>did
the same, and both of them at their coming and going were saluted by
the Cannon. They had private Conferences with him, and other Noblemen
of the <i>Moluccos</i>, who attended him. They erected Factories in
several Parts of <i>Amboyna</i>, and agreed that the two Ships,
<i>Guelder</i> and <i>Zealand</i>, should Sail for <i>Banda</i>, whilst
the other two lay two Months to load and rest at <i>Amboyna</i>. We
shall mention hereafter what befel these in <i>Ternate</i>, let us now
return to the other two.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Two</i> Dutch <i>Ships sail for</i>
Banda.</span> They sail&rsquo;d with a fair Wind, but one of them stuck
in the Flats of <i>Ceru</i>, so that she could scarce be got off. Below
<i>Jealau</i>, they met a <i>Portuguese</i> Ship at <i>Naesau</i>, the
Inhabitants of which Place eat Mans Flesh. They pass&rsquo;d on merrily
by <i>Poelsetton</i>, two Leagues short of <i>Banda</i>, on that Side.
It is desert, and uninhabited, infamous, for stronger Reasons, than the
<i>Greeks</i> alledge against the <i>Acroceraunian</i> Rocks. There are
Cryes, Whistles, and <span class="marginnote"><i>Island of
Devils.</i></span> Roarings heard in it at all Times, and dreadful
Apparitions are seen, with Fires ascending through the Air; and long
Experience has shown, that it is inhabited by Devils. Therefore
Sailors, when they pass in Sight of it, which seldom happens without
Storms, make all the Sail they can to get far off, from the very Wind
that blows on it. The <i>Dutch</i> chief Pilot knowing so much,
furiously took such fast hold of the Helm, that all the rest could not
put him from it; He drew it to him violently, thinking that Force drove
on the Ship; his Face grew fiery, and his Breast not being able to
contain his Wind, he breath&rsquo;d fast, and groan&rsquo;d, till being
past the <span class="marginnote">Dutch <i>Pilot frighted by the
Devil</i>.</span> Island, <span class="corr" id="xd21e19526" title=
"Source: the">he</span> grew merry, and whistling loud, scoff&rsquo;d
at the Devil, because he could not cast away the Ship; yet soon after
he was in Disorder again, and dropt the Helm; they recover&rsquo;d him,
and made all sail to go forward. <span class="marginnote"><i>Trade
at</i> Banda.</span> They arriv&rsquo;d at <i>Banda</i>, near the
River, on the fifteenth of the <span class="corr" id="xd21e19537"
title="Source: Mouth">Month</span>. Several <i>Bandese</i> Boats came
out, offering their Spice. The <i>Dutch</i> landed, carrying with them
sundry Commodities, which they expos&rsquo;d in Shops. A rich
<i>Turk</i>, who was in Esteem, entertain&rsquo;d them. They built
Houses on the Island, and a few Days after hear&rsquo;d News of their
Admiral, by some <i>Chinese</i> Ships, that came from <i>Amboyna</i>;
and were inform&rsquo;d, that the <i>Portugueses</i> were already at
War with the Natives, for entertaining and allowing them Factories.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Return thence.</i></span> On the fourth
of <i>July</i>, having settled Trade at <i>Banda</i>, they sail&rsquo;d
thence towards <i>Noeselau</i>, along the Channels of <i>Zeru</i>,
without regarding their Admiral, who was promoting, and fomenting the
War at <i>Amboyna</i>. They sail&rsquo;d in Sight of <i>Bouton</i>,
which is in five Degrees of South Latitude, and of the Island
<i>Cobayna</i>. On the twelfth they pass&rsquo;d the Coast of
<i>Celebes</i>, and on the seventeenth, by that of <i>Madura</i>, and
again discover&rsquo;d <i>Arosbay</i>, where the Misfortune we have
spoken of befel them. They ran along the Coast of <i>Java</i>, and in
the Evening came to <i>Iacatra</i>, where they cast Anchor, sent to
visit the King, and their Compliment was return&rsquo;d by him with a
Present of Rice, Fowl, and Coco-Nuts, and a Buffalo for the
Vice-Admiral. The <i>Zealanders</i>, who had been left at <i>Banda</i>
in their Houses and Factories, in the Cities of <i>Montelongo</i>, and
<i>Soleparvo</i>, by Letters of the first of <i>August</i>, acquainted
them, how the new Friendship was establish&rsquo;d. From this Time the
<i>Dutch</i> began, without any Opposition, to possess themselves of
the Provinces belonging to the Crown of <i>Spain</i> in
<i>Asia</i>.</p>
<p>They took Leave of that King, and return&rsquo;d to <i>Banda</i>,
with the Natives <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169"
name="pb169">169</a>]</span>of which Place they had now contracted such
Familiarity, that some Ships belonging to <i>Bandese</i> Merchants,
which they met by the Way, presented them with a considerable Quantity
of Porcelane. At their Arrival the Governour came out to meet them,
with 400 Men, inviting them to take some Refreshment ashore, which they
refus&rsquo;d, but made presents to each other, and drank out great
Vessels of Wine made of Rice, which is a powerful and strong Liquor.
Continuing their Voyage on the tenth of <i>September</i>, towards the
South West, they thought they were under the Tropick of
<i>Capricorn</i>. On the thirtieth, they were in 28 Degrees, with the
Wind at West, somewhat Northerly, and ran thirty Leagues beyond Cape
<i>S. Roman</i>, after they had been toss&rsquo;d among many Islands,
in thirty two Degrees and a half South. Next they discover&rsquo;d Cape
<i>Ploemera</i>, of the Southern <i>Ethiopia</i>, or Land of the
<i>Cafres</i>. A Storm dispers&rsquo;d the Ships, but they met again
when it ceas&rsquo;d, at Cape <i>Anquillos</i>. On the seventh of
<i>September</i> they arriv&rsquo;d at the Island <i>S. Helena</i>; the
Master went ashore, kill&rsquo;d many wild Beasts; and, <span class=
"marginnote"><i>S.</i> Helena <i>Island</i>.</span> furnish&rsquo;d the
Ships with Fruit, there being Plenty of both. The Sick recovered there:
They went into the solitary Church, and on the first of <i>January</i>,
1600, they sail&rsquo;d thence, and being come into five Degrees of
North Latitude, on the Thirtieth of the same Month, observ&rsquo;d an
Eclypse. Then they began to discover the North Pole, which had been out
of their Sight so long. On the thirteenth of <i>February</i> they had
Sight of the Island <i>Mayo</i>, or <i>May</i>, one of those of <i>Cabo
Verde</i>, and about the End of <i>March</i> discover&rsquo;d the
<i>English</i> Hills. In fine, they arriv&rsquo;d at the <i>Texel</i>,
and thence to <i>Amsterdam</i>, where they unladed that spicy Wealth,
the like, for Quality and Newness, had never yet been brought to
<i>Lisbon</i>; at least <i>Hugo&rsquo;s</i> Relations tell us, there
might have been as precious Oyl drawn from these, as when they were
just gather&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>Whilst these two Ships, <i>Zealand</i> and <i>Guelder</i>, were
sailing Home, the <span class="marginnote"><i>The other</i> Dutch
<i>Ships depart the</i> Moluccos:</span> other two, <i>Amsterdam</i>
and <i>Utretcht</i>, being almost naturaliz&rsquo;d at <i>Amboyna</i>,
departed thence for <i>Ternate</i>, on the eigth of <i>March</i>, 1599,
in the Company of three <i>Junks</i>, full of <i>Javanese</i> Soldiers,
well arm&rsquo;d, and hir&rsquo;d to attack a Fort that was defended by
<i>Portugueses</i>. Before their Departure, some of them went ashore,
and among other Game, took Abundance of green Pigeons, <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Green Pigeons.</i></span> as big as our Ducks. They
loaded with Clove, because it is sold in that Island for thirty five
Royals a Bar, which is there 150 Pounds. They were inform&rsquo;d, that
the <i>Dutch</i>, who had been left at <i>Banda</i>, would soon come to
joyn them. The <i>Portugueses</i> attacking a Fort with ill Success,
the <i>Dutch</i>, who were before agreed with the Prince of
<i>Ternate</i>, arm&rsquo;d, and mix&rsquo;d with his Men. This was the
first Time they ever Fought with the Subjects of <i>Spain</i>, in those
Parts; and the <i>Dutch</i> Author, who gives an Account of this
Action, says, the Islanders look&rsquo;d upon it as a Prodigy.</p>
<p>Having settled Commerce at <i>Amboyna</i>, they sail&rsquo;d away
for the Islands of <i>Ternate</i>, taking for their Guide, a Captain,
who pretended to them, <span class="marginnote">Dutch <i>at</i>
Ternate.</span> that he was Brother to the King of an Island; and to
magnify his Grand-Father, boasted he had kept seventy lawful Wives,
besides Concubines; and that his Son, to vye with him, had forty Wives,
besides Mistresses. So says the Journal of that Voyage, writ by them
who perform&rsquo;d it. They discover&rsquo;d the Islands of
<i>Tydore</i> and <i>Ternate</i> on the twenty sixth, and coming to an
Anchor at the latter, in fifteen Fathom Water, put out their
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name=
"pb170">170</a>]</span>Colours, fired their Cannon, and spar&rsquo;d
for no real or vain Ostentation. The King of <i>Ternate</i>, whose deep
known Sagacity is such, that he trusts no other but himself to observe
what Dangers may threaten, went into his own <i>Carcoa</i>, attended by
many others, on the 28th of <i>May</i>, and sail&rsquo;d <span class=
"marginnote"><i>The King goes to view the Ships.</i></span> to the
Place, where the <i>Dutch</i> lay at Anchor. He drew near and
inclos&rsquo;d the Ships, call&rsquo;d to the Admiral, and ask&rsquo;d
him, who he was, whence his Ships, and other Particulars. These
Questions and Answers held some Hours, by Means of the
<i>Naguatato</i>&rsquo;s who interpreted the Discourse. The Admiral
intreated the King that he would please to come aboard his Ship. He
excus&rsquo;d himself, first alledging, that he did not like those
Ladders they show&rsquo;d him to go up to them, tho&rsquo; they had
purposely cover&rsquo;d them with fine Cloth; and afterwards, that the
Sun was setting, and it was Time for him to repair to his Devotions.
Having made this godly Excuse, he sail&rsquo;d towards the City, the
Air resounding with the Noise of his Brass Basons, Flat Tabors, Guns,
Shouts, and <i>Persian</i> Songs.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>He returns.</i></span> The 29th he drew
near to the new Comers again, with 23 <i>Carcoas</i>; in which he had
100 Brass Guns for his Defence, and firing them all at once, to the
clattering of Bells, made show of his Warlike Preparation. The
Confusion of it being over, tho&rsquo; they sang Verses, as they do to
denote Peace, in the <i>Malay</i> Tongue, so they call the Language of
<i>Malaca</i>, whence it was convey&rsquo;d to the <i>Moluccos</i>; yet
the <i>Dutch</i> made ready their great Guns, Muskets, and half Pikes.
They plac&rsquo;d some arm&rsquo;d Men out of Sight in every Ship, as
also where they might be taken Notice of, showing, or at least not
concealing their Jealousy, that so no sudden Surprize might find them
unprovided. The King&rsquo;s <i>Carcoa</i> drew near alone, and those
who were in it spoke to the <i>Dutch</i> Admiral, by Means of the
<i>Naguatato</i>, without showing themselves.</p>
<p>The King was satisfy&rsquo;d with only talking to them, and
withdrew; after Noon he return&rsquo;d with only two <i>Carcoas</i>,
one of which tow&rsquo;d a Boat after <span class="marginnote"><i>Talks
with the</i> Dutch.</span> her. Being come up to the <i>Dutch</i>, he
began to talk to the Vice-Admiral; enquir&rsquo;d after their Guns, and
order&rsquo;d the other <i>Carcoa</i> to stand further off, and the
Captain going too far, the Boat, either accidentally, or by Design,
broke loose from the Stern, and was over-set by the Waves; the King
then desired the Admiral to fire at it with a Ball, that he might see
whether they could hit or sink it. They fir&rsquo;d immediately, the
King being well pleas&rsquo;d to see that the Shot had stav&rsquo;d the
Boat in Pieces. The Admiral laying hold of this Opportunity, took Care,
whilst they were commending the Shot, which serv&rsquo;d to disguise
the Threat, to let him know that he could with as much Ease sink the
<i>Carcoas</i>. This Tryal satisfy&rsquo;d the <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Gives them leave to Trade.</i></span> King, who soon
after gave leave for that Nation to Trade in his Dominions, and barter
Cloves, Spice, precious Stones, and Pearls, all which is there to be
found, by reason of the Resort of the <i>Japonese</i>, <i>Camboxa</i>
and <i>Chinese</i> Ships. Of these last they then saw some all made of
Wood alone, even to their Anchors, and the Sails of Cane. They came to
an Anchor at <i>Ternate</i>, where the first Thing they did, was
burying of <i>Reynart Reynarts</i>, a <i>Dutch</i> Soldier, scarce
worthy of that Buryal, Idolaters and <i>Mahometans</i> resorting to the
Funeral. The King the next Day sent a <i>Carcoa</i> to acquaint the
<i>Dutch</i>, that he would go aboard their Ships, and a Boat
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name=
"pb171">171</a>]</span>came to the Admiral&rsquo;s Side, with only four
<i>Ternates</i> in a private Habit, who, by their Questions, Curiosity,
and Solicitude, seem&rsquo;d to be Spyes, as they did by all their
Discourse, which was on sundry Subjects, and very full of solid
Reflection; which was held on, and listen&rsquo;d to, with Attention
and Dissimulation.</p>
<p>When the <i>Dutch</i> expected the King would come, they understood
he <span class="marginnote"><i>The King visits the</i> Dutch, <i>in
Disguise</i>.</span> was one of the four then talking to them from the
Boat. They signify&rsquo;d to him that they knew him, and he did not
deny it. They pay&rsquo;d him the Respect due to a King; but then he
refus&rsquo;d to return to the Ship. Notwithstanding these Jealousies,
he approved of the Behaviour of that People. On the second of
<i>June</i> Embassadors went ashore, who carry&rsquo;d the King a
Present, which he accepted of, and treated them courteously. They
return&rsquo;d, full of Admiration of the infinite Quantity of Cloves,
and the wonderful Woods of them; and bringing the News, that the
<i>Ternates</i> would soon come to view and buy the <i>Dutch</i>
Commodities.</p>
<p>The next Day they came in great Numbers, <i>Sangiacks</i>,
<i>Cachiles</i>, and Commons, Barbarian Ladies, and all Sorts of Women,
with Variety of <span class="marginnote"><i>Concourse of People to
the</i> Dutch.</span> Attendance. The Shores were cover&rsquo;d with
sundry Sorts of People; differing in Habit, Colour, and great Diversity
of Feathers; among them many naked, and of various Countenances, for
all flock&rsquo;d out, as if it had been some publick Festival.
Tho&rsquo; they admir&rsquo;d the Wealth of the Ships, yet they
rais&rsquo;d the Price of the Bars of Clove so high, that they could
not come to any Agreement, because that was to be their main Loading.
They went ashore on the 10th and 11th, to see whether they abated any
Thing of the Price, and to some other Purposes, which do not concern
us, tho&rsquo; they might be some Ornament, but shall be left in the
Originals where they were writ. They could not conclude any Thing with
the King, or his Subjects, because they were celebrating a Festival,
and the <i>Dutch</i> were present at the Shows.</p>
<p>A Sort of Combatants, like the <i>Roman Pugiles</i>, and
<i>Gladiators</i>, tho&rsquo; <span class="marginnote">Indian
<i>Gladiators</i>.</span> differing in some Respects, fought in a large
spacious Square. These <i>Ternates</i> did not move from one Place to
another, nor hurt one another, but stood continually upon one Foot,
without changing or easing it, on any Account; but the Foot that was
lifted up, mov&rsquo;d about and stretch&rsquo;d in the Air, without
being put to the Ground. Their Mistresses, Wives, or Sisters attended
in the Field, with Branches of Flowers, and <i>China</i> Dishes full of
<i>Aromatick</i> Liquors, to refresh those that were tyr&rsquo;d; but
most of them attended the Conqueror. The Sport being ended, the next
Day the King repair&rsquo;d to the Ships, but went not aboard.
Discoursing with the Admiral, he ask&rsquo;d him for a gilt Musket,
which he presented him, and <span class="marginnote"><i>The King asks a
Musket, and pays for it.</i></span> the King did not think fit to
receive Gratis, because he had ask&rsquo;d for it; he therefore
order&rsquo;d, that when the <i>Dutch</i> paid the Tithe of the Spice,
which is the Duty he has from Merchants, they should have two Bars and
a half discounted for the Price of the Musket, and that they should be
furnish&rsquo;d with every Thing they had Occasion for besides. He was
well pleas&rsquo;d one Day, that the <i>Dutch</i> should see how a Boy
of eleven Years of Age, was led about the Streets, with his Hands
bound, because he had stolen a <i>Tubac</i>, <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Severe Punishment of petty Larceny.</i></span> that is,
a Leaf of a Frail, with as many Cloves as it would carry; because this
was an Instance of their Severity in punishing that Offence.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name=
"pb172">172</a>]</span>The other Boys, shouted and sham&rsquo;d him,
proclaiming the Theft with loud Voices.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Triumph of</i> Ternates.</span> About
this Time some <i>Ternate</i> Troops return&rsquo;d Home victorious,
having plunder&rsquo;d and destroy&rsquo;d a Town in the Island of
<i>Tydore</i>. They march&rsquo;d into the City on the 20th of
<i>July</i>, the King being present, with their <i>Campilanes</i>, or
Cymiters drawn, and bloody, with half Heads, Ears, and Hair of those
they had conquer&rsquo;d, or slain, sticking to them. They show&rsquo;d
the Shields and Weapons they had taken from them, their Cloaths and
Feathers, and 43 Prisoners, who follow&rsquo;d dragging Chains, some
about their Necks, and some at their Heels. Among them was a brave
Youth, 21 Years of Age, who was a <i>Sangiack</i> of Note, and Kinsman
to the King of <i>Tydore</i>; as also a very beautiful
<i>Portuguese</i> Lady, Wife to a Captain in that Fort. They
walk&rsquo;d about the City, with all this State and Plunder, till they
came to <span class="marginnote"><i>Prisoners
sacrific&rsquo;d.</i></span> the King&rsquo;s Palace; there the
Captives were sacrific&rsquo;d, and the <i>Portuguese</i> Lady sold for
a Slave, a rare Piece of Mercy, and purchas&rsquo;d by her Tears. The
King of <i>Ternate</i> honour&rsquo;d the Chief of the <i>Tydores</i>,
smiling and lovingly encouraging him, as Kinsman to a King. The Youth
excusing himself, and pleading Innocence, to gain the Victor&rsquo;s
Favour, he return&rsquo;d a favourable Answer, and bid him wash
himself. Sweet Water was brought to wash their Hands, and it was poured
over the King&rsquo;s Hands and his, at the same Time, out of one Ewer.
Then the Captive thus assur&rsquo;d, letting fall his Hands with the
Water, which, perhaps, is a Ceremony to denote Peace, and bowing his
Head by way of civility, a Soldier struck him on <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Barbarous Perfidiousness.</i></span> the Neck with a
sharp <i>Campilane</i>, or Cymiter, so furiously, that the Head dropt
at some Distance from the Body half alive; then they cut both the Head
and Body into small Pieces, all which, to exercise their utmost Rage,
they put into a <i>Prau</i>, which is a little Boat, and then sunk all
together in the Sea.</p>
<p>Four Days after another Parcel of <i>Ternates</i> came with several
<i>Tydore</i> <span class="marginnote"><i>More of their
Cruelty.</i></span> Prisoners, whose Heads they cut off in the Port, as
they did that of a Stranger, who came peaceably to the Island with
Merchandize. All these Spectacles the <i>Dutch</i> beheld. Such good
Use do those Barbarians make of Victory. Friendship being now
establish&rsquo;d with the <i>Dutch</i>, and the King <span class=
"marginnote"><i>The King aboard the</i> Dutch <i>Ships</i>.</span> well
assur&rsquo;d of it, he resolv&rsquo;d to go aboard their Ships. He
went aboard the Admiral on the 25th of <i>July</i>, with all his Guard,
where nothing escap&rsquo;d being narrowly view&rsquo;d and
observ&rsquo;d by him, with a seeming willingness to buy it. He desired
the Admiral to leave some of his Men at <i>Ternate</i>, which was
refus&rsquo;d at that Time. He view&rsquo;d the Ship over again, and
going into the Cook-Room, very much admir&rsquo;d a Pair of Bellows,
wherewith they kindled the Fire in his Presence, and seeing the Use
they were put to, took them into his own Hands, and was a considerable
Time opening and shutting of them; then biting and pressing the Nozle
with his Lips, <span class="marginnote"><i>Foolish Behaviour of
his.</i></span> he began to swallow the Wind it blow&rsquo;d out,
swelling himself up, not without much Laughter and Astonishment of the
<i>Dutch</i>, who write, they Thought the King was either running Mad,
or had no Sense before. He begg&rsquo;d those Bellows, and being
presented with them, was highly pleas&rsquo;d. He return&rsquo;d
several Times after to the Ships, with a greater Design in his Head,
which was to try whether he could by any Means contrive to seize them.
He was pleas&rsquo;d to see how affectionately his Subjects
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name=
"pb173">173</a>]</span>traded and trusted them with their Spice. At
length they prevail&rsquo;d upon the Admiral to leave some of his Men,
with a good Sum of Money, to <span class="marginnote">Dutch <i>Factory
at</i> Ternate.</span> buy up Cloves the next gathering. The first
<i>Dutch</i> Factors left at <i>Ternate</i>, were <i>Francis
Verdoes</i>, Father to <i>William</i>; <i>Diricht Floris</i>, <i>Jacob
Lamberts</i>, <i>John Jans</i>, of <i>Grol</i>; <i>Cornelius
Adrians</i>, and a Boy of <i>Amsterdam</i>, whose Name was <i>Henry
Jans</i>. These laid the Ground for the second Enmity, with the first
Rebells of that Nation, who conspir&rsquo;d with the <i>Ternates</i>,
and were afterwards the Occasion of other Fleets and Succours coming
into those Parts, against their Natural Sovereign.</p>
<p>These Men being left at <i>Ternate</i>, and having receiv&rsquo;d
Intelligence that <span class="marginnote">Dutch <i>depart</i>
Ternate.</span> the Brigantines were returning from the Island of
<i>Banda</i>, the Ships sail&rsquo;d from <i>Ternate</i>, on the 19th
of <i>August</i>, passing by the Island <i>Maca</i>, among the other
<i>Moluccos</i>, and that of <i>Oba</i>, to the Northward. Then in two
Degrees and a half Latitude, they discover&rsquo;d so many Islands,
that they could not count them; others they saw, not set down in the
Maps, and learnt their Names from some Sailors. Among them was that of
<i>Banquore</i>, and its Neighbour <i>Sabobe</i>, whose King resides in
that of <i>Mitara</i>, and has 30 more within a very small Compass. He
furnish&rsquo;d them with Provisions, and gave Notice of Dangerous
Ridges of Rocks; to avoid which, they return&rsquo;d the same Way they
came, in Sight of <i>Amboyna</i> and <i>Celebes</i>. On the 13th of
<i>November</i>, they were inform&rsquo;d at <i>Jaquetra</i>, that the
Vice-Admiral was already gone from <i>Banda</i>; and had there a great
Quantity of Rice, brought but just before by <i>Chinese</i>
Vessels.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Come to</i> Banda.</span> On the 17th
they came to <i>Banda</i>, where at <i>Montelongo</i>, and
<i>Soleparvo</i>, they found the two <i>Zealand</i> Ships, which having
traded about eight Months with little Profit, design&rsquo;d to return.
On the 15th of <i>January</i> 1600, the Admiral made the Governour of
<i>Banda</i> some <i>European</i> Presents, and among them a small
Boat, all cover&rsquo;d with fine Scarlet. All the Merchants met and
set sail for <i>Holland</i>, on the 21th of the same Month, and
sail&rsquo;d all <i>February</i>, with stormy Winds, and loss of some
of their Men, till the Weather mended on the third of <i>March</i>. On
the 13th of <i>April</i>, in the Latitude of 34 Degrees and a half,
they found themselves somewhat <span class="marginnote"><i>At the Cape
of</i> Good Hope.</span>above 20 Leagues from the Cape of <i>Good
Hope</i>. On the 16th of <i>May</i>, they reach&rsquo;d the Island of
St. <i>Helena</i>, where, at some Distance, they discover&rsquo;d other
Ships. Some Men landed, and admir&rsquo;d its strange Fertility among
those Mountains. They saw another Island, whose bare Rocks,
<span class="marginnote"><i>S.</i> Helena.</span> without Trees or
Grass, look as if they were made of Coals; and among them are Abundance
of monstrous wild Boars, yet nothing could be seen to grow, or any
living Creatures they could feed upon; There were also <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Desart Island.</i></span> large Tortoises, some of them
weighing 400 Weight. On the last of <i>May</i> they made for the
<i>Texel</i>, and thence to <i>Amsterdam</i>, where they were
receiv&rsquo;d with publick Rejoycing; and they again prepar&rsquo;d to
return to <i>India</i>, and continuing their Trade with those barbarous
Kings, who are Masters of the Spice, Metals, precious Stones, Pearls,
and other foreign Wealth, have at length converted the Friendship they
kindly offer&rsquo;d at first, into Slavery, and Subjection to the
Tyranny of <i>Holland</i> and <i>Zealand</i>. And in the Year 1600,
with more Expedition, they sail&rsquo;d into <i>Guinea</i>, and to
<i>S. George de la Mina</i>, with only two Ships, the first Time, and
ran through the same Ports and Islands, throughout our Seas in Safety.
They <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=
"pb174">174</a>]</span>took particular Accounts of all Things, whether
Natural, or Political, relating to that vast extended Country of
<i>Asia</i>, which is almost opposite to <i>Europe</i>, and under other
Stars, and another Pole. The same Year, being in search of the
<i>North-Passage</i>, in 80 Degrees of Latitude, they discover&rsquo;d
<span class="marginnote">Nova Zembla.</span> <i>Nova Zembla</i>, where
they found nothing but monstrous white and grey Bears, which did not
run, but rather took little Notice of the Noise of Cannon, and
devour&rsquo;d Men; there were also white Crows, no less undaunted; and
in short, most of that Part of the World was desart, and they found not
the Passage they expected into the South-Sea. Yet they now sail&rsquo;d
all those Southern Parts, at all Seasons, making a Jest of the
<i>Monsons</i>, the <i>Portugueses</i> so mightily observe, as if they
had them shut up in Skins, like the Fable in <i>Ulysses</i>. Perhaps
they buy fair and stormy Winds, as is said to be done in
<i>Lapland</i>, at settled Rates, of Witches that deal in them.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Vanity of the King of</i>
Ternate.</span> The King of <i>Ternate</i> was so puff&rsquo;d up with
the Friendship, and Support of the Northern Nations, that he durst
boldly flatter himself with the Hope of becoming absolute Master of
<i>Tydore</i>. Accordingly he streightned that King, and the
<i>Portuguese</i> Garrison, without allowing them the least Respite.
Other <i>Dutch</i> Ships had come since the former to that Island, on
Account of Trade, by the Way of <i>India</i>, with Arms and several
Commodities. The <i>Ternate</i> Embassadors were treating in
<i>England</i> and <i>Holland</i>, for settling of perpetual Peace and
Commerce. The King had already received Answers to these Embassies, and
very speedily expected an <i>English</i> Fleet, and many <i>Dutch</i>
Ships, with whose Assistance he promis&rsquo;d himself to destroy
<i>Tydore</i>, and thence to stretch out to the <i>Philippines</i>. In
the mean while, some <i>Dutch</i> and <i>English</i> remain&rsquo;d at
his Court, like Hostages, with a Factor, whose Business was to attend
the Bartering, or buying up of Spice; to purchase which they brought
him Abundance of curious Arms. This being known to the King of
<i>Tydore</i>, and <i>Ruy Gonzalez de Sequeyra</i>, Commander of the
Fort, who every Year writ to the <span class="marginnote"><i>Embassy
from</i> Tydore <i>to the</i> Philippines.</span> Governour of the
<i>Philippines</i> about it; they now sent a particular Embassy to
<i>Don Francisco Tello</i>, giving him an Account of the Condition of
those Places; of the Fort; of the Succours, and how vain it was to
expect them from <i>India</i>. That an Affair of such Consequence might
sort the desired <span class="marginnote"><i>The King&rsquo;s Brother
Embassador.</i></span> Event, they appointed <i>Cachil Cota</i>, the
King of <i>Tydore</i>&rsquo;s Brother, a notable Soldier, and most
renowned Commander of the <i>Moluccos</i>, to go Embassador. He came to
<i>Manila</i>, well attended, with Letters from the King, and the
Commander in Chief. Those, and he, in a set Speech, (for the People of
the <i>Moluccos</i> do not want Rhetorick to perswade) return&rsquo;d
the Governour Thanks for the Supplies he had at several Times sent them
of Provisions, and Ammunition. <i>But what we come to desire,</i> said
<i>Cachil Cota, is that this Work be now effectually taken in Hand,
before the</i> English <i>and</i> Dutch <i>with their Fleets
strengthen</i> Ternate<i>, and render it impregnable. We cannot but
admire, that whereas the</i> Portuguese <i>Arms obtain such signal
Victories, as are those of</i> Calicut<i>; over the</i> Turks<i>,
at</i> Diu<i>; over the</i> Egyptians<i>; over the People of</i>
Cananor<i>, of</i> Ceylon<i>, the</i> Javas, Sumatra<i>, and other
Nations on that Side; and the</i> Spaniards <i>on this, against those
of</i> Camboxa, Mindanao, Japan, Cochinchina<i>, and</i> China<i>, yet
only we of the</i> Moluccos<i>, who lie amidst the Dominions of one
only Monarch, should be left <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href=
"#pb175" name="pb175">175</a>]</span>expos&rsquo;d to the utmost Fury
of a Parcel of Rebellious Islands. If the King of</i> Spain <i>allows,
or rather commands, we should be reliev&rsquo;d by the Way of the</i>
Philippine <i>Islands, Why is he not obey&rsquo;d? What does it avail
to carry on a cool War, against a hot and watchful Enemy?</i> The
Governour answer&rsquo;d to every Point, and having entertain&rsquo;d
him, and given Hopes of greater Supplies, when he could be secure
against the mighty Preparations then making at <i>Japan</i>, he
dismiss&rsquo;d him, with a considerable Recruit of Artillery and
Ammunition, and some experienced Soldiers. However these Succours being
so much inferior to the Power of the Enemy, and their own Fear, which
made them expect much greater, they could not put them out of Care.
This made them send Captain <i>Marcos Dias de Febra</i>, <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Another Embassy.</i></span> their last Embassador to
the <i>Philippines</i>, during the Government of <i>Don Francis
Tello</i>. He carry&rsquo;d Letters from the King and <i>Ruy
Gonzalez</i>, to the Governour and Council, which being almost all of
them much of the same Purport, we will here insert one of them,
directed to Doctor <i>Antony Morga</i>, one of that Council, writ with
the King&rsquo;s own Hand, and in the <i>Portuguese</i> Language.</p>

should be there made of the first Alliance concluded by Means of Sir

of his Palace. Where we may observe the perfect Hatred he shows for the
<i>Portuguese</i> Government, since he never Names those People without
adding the Epithet of <i>Mortal Enemies</i>; and in speaking of the
<i>Dutch</i>, <i>My Friends and Deliverers</i>; adding, That he expects
their Fleets with great Satisfaction. This Answer he sent King
<i>James</i> by <i>Henry Middleton</i>, then Admiral of the
<i>English</i> Fleet, on the eighteenth of <i>July</i>, 1605. The Truth
of the Fact is, that this King admitted, and invited to his Dominions,
and the Product of them, all other Nations, to arm against the
<i>Spaniards</i>, and oppose Christianity; and tho&rsquo; he then
boasted of the Succours he receiv&rsquo;d, and expected from the
<i>Dutch</i>, had he seen the Power of their Fleets and Arms decline,
he would have excluded them the Trade. All his Religion and Hopes were
subservient to the present Circumstances of Times, and his Faith
depended on the Advantages he could make.</p>

<p class="first">All the Contents of the Letters, and other Papers,
that came from the <i>Molucco</i> Islands to <i>India</i> and the
<i>Philippines</i>, for the following Years, amount to nothing but
Complaints, asking Relief, and giving Intelligence, not altogether
below the Dignity of History, were we not come so near the last Period
of it. Particularly there are Letters of the Commander of
<i>Tydore</i>, <i>Ruy <span class="corr" id="xd21e20707" title=
"Source: Gontalez">Gonzalez</span> de Sequeyra</i>, to the Governor of
the <i>Philippine</i> Islands, wherein he complains, <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Complaints from</i> Tydore, <i>and other
Advice</i>.</span> That whereas he had sent 400 Men, Ships, and Warlike
Stores to <i>Camboxa</i>, where his Majesty had nothing to Recover, he
had furnish&rsquo;d him with only twenty Soldiers. He represents to him
many pressing Wants, without any Hopes of Relief from the Viceroy, by
the way of <i>Malaca</i>; urging the scarcity of Provisions, Arms, and
all other Necessaries. He informs him, That through his Means <i>Cachil
Mole</i> had been sworn King of <i>Tydore</i>; and how faithful a
Friend he approves himself to the Crown of <i>Sian</i>, and an Enemy to
the <i>Ternates</i>, and that he is always sollicitous for recovering
of that Fort. He desires him to send the King a Present of great Guns,
and other Gifts, and to do the same by the King of <i>Sian</i>, who is
a Christian, and our Friend. He acquaints him how frequently the
<i>English</i> and <i>Dutch</i> Ships resort to those Seas, and that he
had taken some of them.</p>
<p>The Success of a very great and rich Ship of <i>Zealand</i>, is most
particularly Remarkable: This Vessel putting into <i>Ternate</i>, and
Trading with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=
"pb178">178</a>]</span>that Wicked Faithless King, he consented that
<i>Ruy Gonzalez</i> should contrive <span class="marginnote"><i>Villany
of the King of</i> Ternate.</span> to cut her Cables, provided the
Booty might be his: He agreed to it, exacting an Exorbitant price for
the Villany. The Bargain made, and the Bribe receiv&rsquo;d, they who
had cut the Cables leap&rsquo;d over-board, and immediately the
King&rsquo;s Officers appear&rsquo;d, who seiz&rsquo;d all the Loading,
the Ship being beaten to pieces, to no purpose. He assures him, That
the Enterprize on <i>Ternate</i> might be effected with 400
<i>Spaniards</i>; and promises to send him a great piece of Amber, as
an extraordinary Rarity, from the Isles of <i>Mava</i>, which are 60
Leagues from the <i>Moluccos</i>. He again gives Advice of Northern
Galeons, and that one of them, in four Hours, had batter&rsquo;d that
Fort, shot into it 261 Bullets; one of which he sent him; and that they
had beaten down a large Curtin of the Wall, which was then
Repairing.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">English <i>Infest the</i>
West-Indies.</span> In the mean while <i>England</i> infested the
<i>West-Indies</i>; where the Towns and Ships suffer&rsquo;d by their
Invasions, Robberies, and Burnings. Only that Part, which was the
District belonging to <i>Don Pedro de Acunna</i>, defended it self,
through the Bravery of its Governor, and for the same Reason the Enemy
had Regard to it. <i>William Park</i>, the <i>English</i> Admiral,
appear&rsquo;d upon the strong and garrison&rsquo;d Coasts of

prevail&rsquo;d in some Places. On the Coast of <i>Cartagena</i> he
took one <i>Julio</i>, a Fisherman, whom he <span class="corr" id=

<p><span class="marginnote"><i>A&rsquo;miral</i> Parke&rsquo;s
<i>Letter to</i> Don Pedro.</span> <i>Being inform&rsquo;d by Fame,
with how much Generosity and Kindness your Lordship entertains
Strangers, especially those of my Nation, I would not forbear
expressing the Gratitude due to your Lordship for that Magnificence, on
my own Part, and returning Thanks, wishing you as long a Life, and as
much Health, as to my self. I would not omit writing these few Lines to
your Lordship, not only on the aforesaid Account, but to acquaint you
with what has happen&rsquo;d to me during this Expedition. It
pleas&rsquo;d God to make me Master of one of the Kings Ports,
call&rsquo;d</i> Porto Belo, <i>which I was possess&rsquo;d of a whole
Day and Part of the Night, where I found some Gentlemen, particularly
Captain</i> Melendez<i>, and some other Soldiers of the Garrison; and
plundering the Place had very little Booty. The said Captain</i>
Melendez, <i>fought like a resolute Soldier, and faithful Servant of
his King, and therefore I order&rsquo;d him to be dress&rsquo;d by my
Surgeon, and to be carry&rsquo;d out of the House where he was wounded,
having laid Wood in all the Houses to fire them, and consume the Town.
I do assure your Lordship, and declare on the Word of a Soldier, that
being inform&rsquo;d of your Valour and Renown, by certain Prisoners I
took, as Captain</i> Rolon<i>, and several others, and at</i> Porto
Belo <i>by the King&rsquo;s Factor,</i> Funes<i>, and other Soldiers,
that were my Prisoners, and aboard my Ship, I gave them all their
Liberty, and forebore firing the City, only on Account of your
Reputation, and the Fame of your good Usage to such Prisoners as fall
into your Hands. So that those I set at Liberty, as also the Town, may
be thankful to your Lordship for so great an Obligation, as is the
Value of the said Town, and their Lives. The Castle, and the Fort at
the Mouth of the Harbour, and the Port it self, so well fortify&rsquo;d
and furnish&rsquo;d with Artillery, and all other Necessaries, did not
deter, fright, or daunt me, for I went out with six Ships, and the
Castles did me no Harm. Really the Commanders <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name="pb179">179</a>]</span>and
Guners were very honest Men. I give your Lordship Notice of two</i>

since, their Names are</i> Abraham Collins<i>, and</i> Thomas Hall.
<i>These are both Spies upon</i> Cartagena. <i>I like the Treason, but
drown the Traitor; I send you some poor Men ashore, whom I took upon
this Coast, your Lordship will favour them as is due, and according to
your Custom. And having Nothing else, at present, to acquaint your
Lordship with, pray to God to lengthen your Life, with much Health, and
Prosperity, and to give me good Luck, as is in his divine Power, is
convenient for us, and I wish. From aboard my Ship,</i> February <i>the

<p><i>Don Pedro</i> answer&rsquo;d in few Words, yet so as his Brevity
might not exclude Civility, and the Pyrate being satisfy&rsquo;d,
proceeded on his Voyage. The King had at this Time appointed <i>Don
Pedro</i> to succeed <i>Don Francis <span class="marginnote">Don Pedro
<i>appointed Governor of the</i> Philippines.</span> Tello</i> in the
Government of the <i>Philippine</i> Islands, designing him for those
Enterprizes he afterwards perform&rsquo;d. This his Majesty
judg&rsquo;d a proper Resolution, and safe in the Execution; for what
Person is fit to be pitch&rsquo;d upon to Govern the utmost Limits of
so far extended a Dominion, but such a one as is endu&rsquo;d with both
Valour and Loyalty, two necessary Qualifications to secure the Respect
and Submission due to an absent Prince; a Matter of much Difficulty in
remote Governments?</p>
<p>Since this Gentleman&rsquo;s own Actions, and the great Opinion his
very Enemies had conceiv&rsquo;d of them, are sufficient Testimonies of
his Valour, let us proceed to say something of his Quality. <i>Don
Pedro</i> had the Surname of <i>Bravo</i>, as being Son to <i>Don Lewis
Bravo</i>, who serving under the <span class="marginnote">Don
Pedro&rsquo;s <i>Father</i>.</span> Emperor <i>Charles</i> the fifth,
on the Day the Prince of <i>Orange</i> dy&rsquo;d, ask&rsquo;d Leave to
assault <i>S. Desir</i>, a strong Town in the <i>Low Countries</i>, on
the Banks of the River <i>Matrone</i>. The History of that War informs
us, that some Friends of his Father&rsquo;s, hearing of it,
endeavour&rsquo;d to obstruct it, either by disswading the Son, or
prevailing with the Emperor not to grant him Leave. His Father was
<i>Sancho Bravo de Lagunas</i>, a Gentleman of Quality by Birth, and no
less by his own Actions, at that Time Inspector General of the
Emperor&rsquo;s Forces by Sea and Land, and one of his Council of War.
All Men honour&rsquo;d, and lov&rsquo;d him entirely. They
consider&rsquo;d he had no other Son but <i>Don Lewis</i>, and the
manifest Danger he expos&rsquo;d himself to; but he perceiving what his
Fathers Friends were contriving, took upon him to lead the Van, before
they could have Time to prevent his gaining the Honour he expected; and
assaulted the Place with Success, tho&rsquo; not without some
Imputation of Rashness. His Son <i>Don Pedro</i> did not degenerate,
for the Brave are the Off-spring of the Brave, and the Eagle does not
breed Doves.</p>
<p>The Name of <i>Acunna</i> he took from his Mother, according to the
<span class="marginnote"><i>His Mother.</i></span> Custom of the
Kingdoms of <i>Castile</i>, where noble Families, to keep up the Honour
of the Quality they acquire by Matrimony, use to revive the Names of
their Progenitors even in the Grand-Children. <i>Don Lewis Bravo</i>,
marry&rsquo;d <i>Donna Isabel de Acunna</i>, Daughter to <i>Don Pedro
de Acunna</i>, call&rsquo;d in those Days <i>el Cabezudo</i>,
signifying, either the Head-strong, or Great-Headed, great Grand-Son to
the first Earl of <i>Buendia</i>, a Family of known Antiquity. Among
his Sons, <i>Don Sancho Bravo</i>, the eldest, is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name="pb180">180</a>]</span>now,
when this History was writ, <i>Adelantado</i>, or Lord Lieutenant of
<i>Ternate</i>, and Knight of the Order of <i>Alcantara</i>; <i>Don
Garcia</i>, is Knight of <i>Santiago</i>; <i>Don Lewis</i>, of
<i>Calatrava</i>; <i>Don John</i>, bred in the principal Colledge of
<i>Alcala</i>, went thence to be Gentleman of the Bed-chamber to the
most serene Arch-Duke <i>Albertus</i>, and is since Cannon of the Holy
Church of <i>Toledo</i>, besides other Church Affairs he is always
employ&rsquo;d in. Our <span class="marginnote">Don Pedro <i>Knight
of</i> Malta.</span> <i>Don Pedro</i> was Knight of <i>Malta</i>, and
Commendary of <i>Salamanca</i>.</p>
<p>He departed <i>Cartagena</i>, leaving that Government disconsolate,
and full of the Desire of his Continuance among them. He had a good
Passage, <span class="marginnote"><i>Comes to</i> Mexico.</span> and
being come to <i>Mexico</i>, and entertain&rsquo;d by the Viceroy,
<i>Don Gaspar De Zunnigay Azevedo</i>, Earl of <i>Monterey</i>,
consulted with him about the Expedition and Recovery of the
<i>Molucco</i> Islands, beginning with <i>Ternate</i>, the Head of
them. They admitted to their Consultations some experienc&rsquo;d
Commanders in those Countries. The Result was, the Viceroy&rsquo;s
being well affected to the Expedition, and to the Governour, who was
going to undertake it, which was of no small Consequence, towards
rend&rsquo;ring the Preparations made in <i>New Spain</i> effective.
<i>Don Pedro</i> writ to the King, to his Confessor, to the Duke of
<i>Lerma</i>, and to other Ministers of State, especially the supreme
Councellors of the <i>Indies</i>, very largely, in Relation to this
War, showing how difficult it was, and how great a Dishonour, to permit
a Tyrant to reign so long, he being so near a Neighbour. He said, he
could not secure any Ships, nor even the Provinces, against the
<i>Moluccos</i>; and that, had he not been promis&rsquo;d to be enabled
to recover them, he would never have accepted of the Government of the
<i>Philippine</i> Islands. He sent Brother <i>Gaspar Gomez</i>, a
<i>Jesuit</i>, <span class="marginnote"><i>Arrives at the Islands</i>
Ladrones.</span> with these Letters into <i>Spain</i>, And set out
himself from <i>Mexico</i>, for <i>Acapulco</i>, the Sea-Port-Town of
that Kingdom. Thence he proceeded, with four Ships of <i>New Spain</i>,
to the Islands <i>de los Ladrones</i>, that is of Thieves, otherwise
call&rsquo;d <i>de las Velas</i>, or of Sails, from the great Multitude
of Little Sails seen about them, belonging to Abundance of Boats that
come out to meet the Ships.</p>
<p>He directed his Course to the Isles of <i>Carpana</i>, and that of
<i>Guan</i>, that no Time might be lost without doing good to others.
His Design was to bring off from among those barbarous People, such Men
as had escap&rsquo;d <span class="marginnote"><i>Rich Ships
lost.</i></span> of the Ship <i>Margarita</i>, cast away there the Year
before, with above 1200000 Ducats; and as true Virtue never wants
Matter to work on, he <span class="marginnote"><i>Twenty five Men
sav&rsquo;d.</i></span> deliver&rsquo;d twenty five Men of the many
that suffer&rsquo;d Shipwrack in that Place. Having perform&rsquo;d
this good Work, in twenty six Days he came to the Mouth of the Streight
of the <i>Philippines</i>, and anchor&rsquo;d at <i>Cabite</i>, three
<span class="marginnote">Don Pedro <i>at Manila</i>.</span> Leagues
from <i>Manila</i>; where he was receiv&rsquo;d with incredible, and
universal Joy. His first Care was to be inform&rsquo;d of the Condition
his Predecessor left the Government in. He view&rsquo;d every Part, and
cast off the <i>Sangleys</i>, or <i>Chineses</i>, as thinking they
exceeded the large Number allowed of by the King&rsquo;s Order. Some
interpreted the Exclusion of those People, was only to condemn the
extravagant Liberties they took; but Time soon show&rsquo;d, that there
were other great Advantages reap&rsquo;d by it. In <i>Don Pedro</i> all
Men believ&rsquo;d the Security of the <i>Philippine</i> Islands was
come; for the Governour&rsquo;s Reputation was equal to the Necessities
of his Province; which requir&rsquo;d the Government of an
experienc&rsquo;d Commander, of great Name, and so vigilant as he was.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name=

<p><i>Don Francis Tello</i> resign&rsquo;d up the Power into his Hands,
and staying <span class="marginnote">Don Francis Tello
<i>dyes</i>.</span> there to give an Account of his Administration,
dyed in <i>April</i>, the following Year. The new Governour was much
concern&rsquo;d to find the King&rsquo;s Treasury empty, and himself
under an Obligation of supporting the King&rsquo;s and his own Credit.
To this Consideration belong&rsquo;d the <i>Moluccos</i>, the reducing
whereof he had in Charge. However he took Courage, believing he might
with Industry and Labour, make amends for the Want of Cash. He attended
all the Works in Person, as he had been wont to do, both at
<i>Manila</i> and in the Country about, building Galleys, and other
Vessels, whereof there was then a great Want, to secure the Sea, at
that Time infested <span class="marginnote">Don Pedro <i>visits his
Government</i>.</span> by the Neighbouring Pirates and Enemies,
especially those of <i>Mindanao</i>. Next he visited the Provinces of
the <i>Pintados</i>, and supply&rsquo;d the Wants he found in those
Parts. In these Passages betwixt the Islands, besides the Storms, his
little Vessel, which had only three Soldiers in it, escap&rsquo;d, he
fell into another notable Danger. Two and twenty <i>English</i> Vessels
enrich&rsquo;d with the Booty they had taken in the Islands belonging
to that Government, attempted to inclose and take him, but the Tide
failing them, they stuck on Ground, and could not get off. <i>Don
Pedro</i> saw them <span class="marginnote"><i>Cruelty of</i>
English.</span> throw over-board above 2000 <i>Spaniards</i>, and
Natives they had made Prisoners, to lighten their Vessels. They also
cast into the Sea a beautiful <i>Spanish</i> Maid, about 17 Years of
Age. Afterwards the Fleet from <i>Manila</i> sail&rsquo;d in quest of
them, and chastis&rsquo;d some, tho&rsquo; the Punishment was inferior
to their Cruelty.</p>
<p><i>Don Pedro</i> would fain have remov&rsquo;d all Obstacles that
lay in the Way to the Enterprize he had in Hand; but was oblig&rsquo;d
to put off for some Months that which he was most intent upon, and to
dispatch the Affairs <span class="marginnote">Japonese <i>Embassador
at</i> Manila.</span> of <i>Xolo</i> and <i>Japan</i>. <i>Chiquiro</i>,
a <i>Japonese</i> Embassador, was newly arriv&rsquo;d at <i>Manila</i>,
with a Present of the Product and Manufactures of that Island, and
orders to treat with the Governour, and settle Amity and Commerce,
between the Subjects of the Emperor of <i>Japan</i>, whose Name was
<i>Dayfusama</i>, and the <i>Philippines</i> and <i>New-Spain</i>. The
Neighbourhood of those Provinces, the Power of the <i>Japonese</i>
Kings, their natural Disposition, and other Considerations, which
Experience had shown to be of great Moment, made against refusing of
that Commerce; and yet there were Opinions to the contrary, for those
very Reasons. However that barbarous Prince having once espous&rsquo;d
that Affair, it was not easy to find out an Expedient to settle it,
without any Jealousy or Disgust. <i>Dayfusama</i> demanded, that the
<i>Spaniards</i> should trade to <i>Quanto</i>, a Port in one of his
Provinces, and that such Friendship might be establish&rsquo;d, that
the <i>Japoneses</i> might go over to <i>New-Spain</i>. That the
Governour should send him Ship-wrights, and Workmen to build Ships in
<i>Japan</i>, for performing of that <span class="marginnote"><i>His
Proposals</i>.</span> Voyage, upon which <i>Dayfusama</i> was very
intent, being perswaded to it by a Religious Man of ours, of the Order
of St. <i>Francis</i>, whose Name was <i>F. Jerome</i> of <span class=
"ex"><i>JESUS</i></span>, and for whom that Monarch had a great
Esteem.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Objections to them.</i></span> This was
a Matter of great Weight, and on several Accounts most prejudicial to
the <i>Philippine</i> Islands, whose greatest Security for so many
Years, has consisted in the <i>Japonese</i>&rsquo;s wanting of Ships
and Pilots, and being ignorant in the Art of Navigation. Men of
Experience observ&rsquo;d, that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182"
href="#pb182" name="pb182">182</a>]</span>whensoever the said haughty
barbarous Prince has attempted to arm against <i>Manila</i>, he has
still been obstructed by this Want. They said, that to send him
Ship-Wrights, and Men to build him Ships after the <i>Spanish</i>
Manner, would be no other than arming him against the <i>Spaniards</i>
themselves; and that their Voyages would be destructive to the
<i>Philippines</i> and <i>New-Spain</i>; for that the making the
<i>Japoneses</i> capable of Trading far off, was not only inconvenient,
but unsafe. The Governour <i>Don Pedro de Acunna</i> seriously weighing
all these Reasons, order&rsquo;d the Embassador <i>Chiquiro</i> to be
magnificently entertain&rsquo;d, made him some Presents for his King
and for himself, and sent a Ship with another moderate Present, lest it
should be interpreted to proceed from Fear, if it had been too
considerable. This Ship sail&rsquo;d with <i>Dayfusama</i> and his
Embassador, both of them loaded with Commodities to barter. <i>Don
Pedro</i>&rsquo;s Letters contain&rsquo;d many Compliments, and Thanks
for the good Will he show&rsquo;d towards establishing more solid
Friendship; but that, tho&rsquo; he had ample Commission for all Things
relating to the Government of the <i>Philippine</i> Islands, yet he
could not satisfy that Part of his Embassy, which concern&rsquo;d the
furnishing of him with Sailors and Workmen to build <i>Spanish</i>
Ships, without acquainting the Viceroy of <i>New-Spain</i>, nor could
the Viceroy do it, without special Orders from the King of
<i>Spain</i>. That he promis&rsquo;d to write to them about it, for
promoting the Accomplishment of his reasonable Demands; but that he
must consider, it would be above three Years before they had an Answer,
because of the great Length, and many Accidents of such Voyages. It was
order&rsquo;d that the aforesaid <i>F. Jerome</i> should himself
deliver these Letters, to <i>Dayfusama</i>. The Fryar himself had a
private Letter sent him with a Reproof for what he had done, and
Instructions how to mend it; and that he should signify to the
<i>Japonese</i> Monarch, how highly <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Instructions to</i> F. Jerome.</span> the Governour
valu&rsquo;d the Inclination he show&rsquo;d to settle Peace and
Commerce with the <i>Spaniards</i>, and his Kindness to them; and at
the same Time perswade him to continue that good Correspondence, which
the Governour would inviolably observe; but that he should endeavour to
divert the King&rsquo;s Thoughts from such Designs, and never go about
to facilitate the Execution of them; because, tho&rsquo; perhaps the
Emperor then reigning entertain&rsquo;d no sinister Meaning, nor had
any farther Thought than promoting a sincere Friendship, yet that might
be very prejudicial in the Days of a more mischievous Successor; who
might make an ill Use of his Skill in Navigation, and improve it
against the Persons that taught it him. The Governour promis&rsquo;d he
would soon send another Ship with Commodities to barter; and he might
put the King in Hopes it would carry over some <i>Spanish</i>
Ship-Carpenters to build Ships after their Manner. That he should
desire <i>Dayfusama</i> to wait with Patience, and consider how
heinously he would be offended himself, if any of his Governours should
presume to make any new Settlements in Trade without his Privity or
Order.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Japonese <i>Embassador cast
away</i>.</span> <i>Chiquiro</i> return&rsquo;d for <i>Japan</i> with
this Answer; but when he was off the Head of the Island <i>Formosa</i>,
such a dreadful Storm overtook him, that he was swallow&rsquo;d up, and
neither Men, Goods, nor Arms sav&rsquo;d; and this happen&rsquo;d in so
remote a Place, that it was not known till many Days after.
<i>Dayfusama</i>, at the Request of <i>F. Jerome</i>, had granted Leave
for Preaching of the Gospel, throughout his Dominions, building of
Churches, and such as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href=
"#pb183" name="pb183">183</a>]</span>would professing Christianity by
publick Authority. <i>Don Pedro</i> the Governour <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Religious allow&rsquo;d to Preach in</i> Japan.</span>
took the necessary Measures, that so favourable an Indulgence might not
be lost, and that not only barefoot <i>Franciscans</i>, but also
Religious Men of other Orders should go over thither. They made use of
the <i>Japonese</i> Captains and Ships, newly come to <i>Manila</i>
with Meal. The <i>Dominicans</i> sent over to the Kingdom of
<i>Zazuma</i> four Fryars, and <i>F. Francis de Morales</i>, Prior of
<i>Manila</i> for their Superior, saying the King of that Province sent
for them, being the only one, who had not yet submitted to
<i>Dayfusama</i>. The Order of <i>S. Augustin</i> sent two Religious
Men, and <i>F. James de Guevara</i>, Prior also of <i>Manila</i> for
their Superior, and these went to the Kingdom of <i>Firando</i>. Those
of the Order of <i>S. Francis</i>, sent <i>F. Augustin Rodriguez</i>,
who had been Witness to the Martyrdom of his Companions in
<i>Japan</i>, to <i>Nangasaqui</i>, for him to go thence with a
Lay-Brother to <i>Miaco</i>, and bear <i>F. Jerome</i> of <i>Jesus</i>
Company. Many perswaded <i>Don Pedro</i>, not to send away these
Religious Men; but tho&rsquo; those Perswasions were well grounded, and
some Difficulties occur&rsquo;d against their Departure, he
resolv&rsquo;d to dismiss them. The Zeal of true Glory overcomes all
Opposition. These Religious Men found no Signs of those Desires that
had been signify&rsquo;d to them in the Provinces they went to. Very
few <i>Japoneses</i> were converted, and there was less Disposition to
advance, because the Kings, and <i>Tonos</i>, which are Princes had no
Affection for our Religion, nor were any Way disgusted with their
Idols. They only aspir&rsquo;d to settle Commerce, and to trade with
the <i>Spaniards</i>, for their private Interest.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Another Ship to</i> Japan.</span> <i>Don
Pedro</i> sent the Ship he had promis&rsquo;d to <i>Japan</i>, well
stor&rsquo;d with Cannon, and call&rsquo;d it <i>S. James</i> the Less.
The Captain, Officers, and Sailors were all Men of Experience; and she
was laden with Commodities to barter, Red-Wood, Deer&rsquo;s-Skins, raw
Silk, and several other Sorts. The Govenour order&rsquo;d them to
dispose of what they carry&rsquo;d at the Port of <i>Quanto</i>, and to
furnish the Religious Men they found there, and then return with the
Produce and <i>Dayfusama&rsquo;s</i> Leave. Thus Provision was made for
all the Affairs of <i>Japan</i>, according to the present Exigences.
The Ship-Wrack of the Embassador <i>Chiquiro</i> was known, and by the
good Management of <i>F. Jerome</i>, <i>Dayfusama</i> was acquainted
with the Answer he carry&rsquo;d, and rested satisfy&rsquo;d; so that
the preaching of the Gospel went on in his Dominions.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Furtado&rsquo;s <i>Letter to</i> Don Pedro
<i>concerning the Expedition</i>.</span> <i>Don Pedro&rsquo;s</i>
Thoughts were all bent upon Recovering of the <i>Molucco</i> Islands,
and his other Business did not make him neglect that Enterprize.
<i>Andrew Furtado de Mendoza</i>, Admiral of those Seas for the Crown
of <i>Portugal</i> had writ him Word, that he had Orders from his
Majesty to repair to <i>Ternate</i>; but that he did not expect the
Viceroy would set him out, as was requisite for that Expedition. <i>Don
Pedro</i> answer&rsquo;d him, to his Content, with Assurance, that he
should be supported. These Letters came to the Hands of the
<i>Portuguese</i> Admiral at <i>Malaca</i>, when he was ready to set
out. He presently answer&rsquo;d both those of the 22d of
<i>September</i>, and the 22d of <i>December</i>, signifying how
acceptable they were to him. <i>Because</i>, says he, <i>I love your
Lordship entirely, tho&rsquo; I have never seen you, on Account of your
being a brave Commander, and so zealous for his Majesty&rsquo;s
Service; not to mention other Reasons for which I am yours. I was much
troubled for the Loss of the Ship, and the ill Fortune of the other,
for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name=
"pb184">184</a>]</span>the want you will find of the Return you
expected by them: But it is to be suppos&rsquo;d, that the Viceroy
of</i> New-Spain, <i>seeing how long those Ships were missing, would
impute it to some very considerable Causes, and therefore will Assist
you Powerfully, for nothing less can be expected from such a Viceroy
who, I am told, is a very worthy Gentleman. I am experimentally
sensible of what your Lordship writes to me; for after being in those
Parts five Years, without receiving any Succours from</i> India,
<i>when I expected these Disorders should end, and considerable
Supplies would be sent me, the Viceroy furnish&rsquo;d me so poorly, as
will appear to your Lordship by the List of what he sends, and thence
you may infer, how his Majesty is serv&rsquo;d in those Parts, that
your Lordship may acquaint him with it, and we may joyntly so order it,
that all this may not be overthrown in one Hour.</i></p>
<p>Then he complains, That they have not sent him his Majesty&rsquo;s
Letter, <span class="marginnote"><i>More of the Letter</i>.</span> nor
the Archbishop of <i>Goa</i> had not receiv&rsquo;d his; and says,
<i>He had rather be at Plow in</i> Old Castile, <i>than a Witness to
the ill Disposition of what is committed to his Charge</i>: And
proceeding, says thus, <i>Your Lordship tells me, That as soon as I
draw near the</i> Moluccos, <i>you will do me the favour to have in
readiness for me 300 Soldiers, with Captain</i> Gallinato, <i>and
another Captain, and two Galleys, four Brigantines, and all the</i>
Carcoas <i>that shall be requisite. I know not what his Majesty
appoints for me; but, for the Sins of these Dominions, Time has put
Things into such a Posture, that I must be forc&rsquo;d to repair to
the</i> Moluccos, <i>as well to recover what is Lost, as to save what
is Gain&rsquo;d, which cannot be done, unless both Powers, from hence
and thence, be United. Twelve</i> Dutch <i>Ships anchor&rsquo;d this
Year at the Bar of</i> Goa: <i>They took the Viceroy so unprovided,
that they lay at Anchor a Month at the said Bar, without any Attempt
made to remove them. They made great Havock amongst the Merchants Ships
on the Coast of</i> India, <i>without any Opposition. They came from
the other Sea, by the Back of</i> Sumatra, <i>to the Streight of</i>
Sunda. <i>Seven of them arriv&rsquo;d at</i> Amboyna, <i>the others
being</i> <span class="marginnote"><i>Baseness of a</i> Portuguse
<i>Govenour</i>.</span> <i>then parted from them. When they
enter&rsquo;d over the Bar, the Governour sent two Men, to ask,
whether</i> Don Emanuel <i>was aboard. The Ships hearing of it, went
and Anchor&rsquo;d under the Fort. Then the Governor sent three or four
other Men, who made the Agreement for the surrendering of the Fort.
When it was sign&rsquo;d the</i> Dutch <i>drew near: the Gates were
open&rsquo;d to them, and they admitted without standing one Musket
Shot, or firing a Cannon. They took an Oath of Fidelity to Prince</i>
Maurice, <i>and the Governor after committing the Treason, commanded a
Black of his own to put him into Irons, saying</i>, The People of the
Town had done it. <i>Since that he came hither, and skulks about the
Mountains, and I am very earnest to take him, that I may make an
Example of him. I have already secur&rsquo;d some of the Marry&rsquo;d
Men that came hither, being fully convinc&rsquo;d that the Governor and
they are Enemies and Traytors. When the</i> Dutch <i>were
possess&rsquo;d of the Fort, they put more Cannon into it, with a
Garrison of 140 Men, and Provisions for two Years. I have also received
Intelligence, That they sent five Ships against</i> Tydore, <i>and I am
very jealous of that Place, because of the Divisions there; wherefore I
immediately sent away two Galiots, well Man&rsquo;d, Arm&rsquo;d, and
Provided. God grant they find that Fort in the King&rsquo;s Possession.
Thus, if his Majesty well send hither the Galeons he writes of, and
commands me to serve him in these Southern Parts, I must of necessity
go over that way; for since</i> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185"
href="#pb185" name="pb185">185</a>]</span>Amboyna <i>is in the
Possession of the</i> Dutch, <i>we may conclude</i> Tydore <i>will soon
follow. If they extend their Dominion, from that Port, which God avert,
they will thence put an End to the Affairs of the Moluccos, and of</i>
China, <i>and with the Assistance of the</i> Ternates <i>must of
necessity Infest those Parts about</i> Manila; <i>and therefore we are
all oblig&rsquo;d, as Christians, and his Majesty&rsquo;s Subjects, to
Oppose such a mighty Misfortune. And since the Lot has fallen between
your Lordship, and this Soldier of yours, we seem to be in some measure
both of us under an Obligation to spare no Pains for the Recovering of
those Parts of the</i> Molucco <i>Islands. For my part I will labour
for the Success, tho&rsquo; I were to lose ten Lives, if I had so many.
But because I shall not have an Opportunity to send your Lordship
Intelligence, till a Year hence, I now intreat you to have what
Soldiers you can in Readiness, and the greatest Number of Natives, that
we may not fall short when the work is half done, and be forced, for
want of them, to put our selves into the Hands, and expect the
Assistance of Traytors. The same I beg, as to Provisions; for there are
none where I am at present. But since Captain</i> Gallinato <i>has seen
all, and knows what is Necessary in those Parts, whereof he has before
now given your Lordship ample Information, it will be needless to
repeat it in this, being your Lordship tells me in yours, you do me the
Favour to appoint him for my Companion; and he is so able a Commander,
that when your Lordship orders him to prepare for this Expedition, he
will take with him all he thinks proper for it. Tho&rsquo; his Majesty
should send several Galeons, and many Men, I shall not be able to do
any thing with them in those Parts, because the main Thing there, is to
have Vessels that Row, and Men that have Serv&rsquo;d, whereof I am
very destitute. From</i> India <i>none can come, tho&rsquo; the Viceroy
were never so willing to furnish me. However, confiding in your
<span class="corr" id="xd21e21667" title=
"Source: Lordships">Lordship&rsquo;s</span> Worth, and in what you have
signify&rsquo;d to me by Letter, I will undertake this Expedition,
believing I shall find all Things in such Readiness, that they will set
out from thence the Moment your Lordship receives Advice from me. I am
told your Lordship expects a Gentleman in those Parts, who comes to
Conquer</i> Camboxa. <i>If he happens to come, I must put your Lordship
in Mind, that the best Conquest is that of the</i> Moluccos, <i>where
his Majesty&rsquo;s Forts will be restor&rsquo;d, and there the said
Gentleman may shew his Valour, and merit a considerable Reward from the
King. Before the</i> Dutch <i>came to</i> Amboyna, <i>two</i> English
<i>Ships passed by that Island, which sent a Letter to the Governor of
the Fort, to acquaint him, that the</i> Dutch <i>were coming after
them, with a Design to possess themselves of the said Fort, and
therefore they advised him to behave himself well, because the</i>
Dutch <i>they spoke of, were a poor faint-hearted People. That, if they
had Occasion for Powder, Ball, and all other Necessaries, they were
ready to supply him, because they were then at Peace with</i> Spain,
<i>and the Constable of Castile was already sent into</i> England,
<i>by his Majesty, to Ratify it: And the Post-Master-General was
Embassador in Ordinary. This Intelligence leaves the Rebels no pretence
to any Excuse. Furtado</i>&rsquo;s Letter goes on, to other
Particulars, recommending Religious Men, and Commanders and he
concludes with Abundance of Compliments, and Courteous Expressions.</p>
<p><i>Don Pedro</i> having receiv&rsquo;d these Letters, order&rsquo;d
and hasten&rsquo;d all necessary Preparations, with the utmost
Diligence, pressing the Business in <i>Spain</i>, and with the Viceroy
at <i>Mexico</i>, and thought all Delays tedious; but the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name=
"pb186">186</a>]</span>Approbation of his Advice, and the Supplies to
put it in Execution, being to come from a Center so remote, and where
there lay an Obligation of being no less attentive to all Parts of the
Circumference, the Expedition could <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Brother</i> Gaspar Gomez <i>forwards the
Expedition.</i></span> not possibly be brought about sooner. Brother
<i>Gaspar Gomez</i>, whose Intelligence in this Affair, was always very
material, had presently Intimation of what had been resolv&rsquo;d on,
by Letters from <i>Don Pedro</i>; and he was so diligent in promoting
it, that to advance this Cause, he cross&rsquo;d the greatest Oceans as
readily, as if they had been the Narrow-Seas, which part those Islands;
having solicited the Viceroy at <i>Mexico</i>, and then the
Counsellors, and Ministers of State in <i>Spain</i>. His Arguments and
Motives were the same we have several Times mention&rsquo;d in this
Work. Dividing the Wealth of the South into three fixt Kinds, precious
Stones, and Pearls, Metals, and Spice, and Drugs; all which were
distributed among Enemies, <i>English</i> and <i>Dutch</i>. That the
King had no Spice left, but only that of <i>Tydore</i>, which must be
lost, unless speedily and powerfully supported, and the same Forces
would recover <i>Ternate</i>, <i>Banda</i>, <i>Amboyna</i>, and what
had been held in <i>Celebes</i>, <i>Batochina</i>, and the Places
wrested by the Tyrants of <i>Sumatra</i>. All this the Jesuit made out
by Demonstration, for he grounded not the least Information upon any
thing less than Experience.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Succeeds in his Negociation.</i></span>
He was heard in the Council of the <i>Indies</i>, and the Council of
State for the Crown of <i>Portugal</i>, and dispatch&rsquo;d for the
<i>Philippines</i>, by the way of <i>New-Spain</i>. By the other Way,
the King order&rsquo;d, that the Captain General <i>Furtado</i>, taking
with him the necessary Fleet from <i>Goa</i>, should sail for the
<i>Moluccos</i>, by special Commission, by Virtue whereof he afterward
sent to ask Assistance at the <i>Philippine</i> Islands, as we have
seen, and such Supplies were to be furnish&rsquo;d on both Sides, as
being united, might secure the Conquest of the <i>Moluccos</i>. However
the Event must of Necessity be tedious, the <i>Dutch</i> being already
possess&rsquo;d of all the King&rsquo;s Forts in the
<i>Archipelago</i>; and their numerous Fleets of all the Ports, Fairs,
and Trade, with Factories conveniently settled for their Intercourse
between <i>India</i> and their own Country. We shall not enter upon the
Account of those Affairs, because no more of them than have been
already mention&rsquo;d, as yet related to the <i>Moluccos</i>. Much
Time, and many Precautions were requisite, for these two Commanders to
joyn, amidst so many Obstacles: They sent frequent Advice backward and
forward, and neither Part was idle in the mean while.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Furtado <i>Sails from</i> Goa.</span> At
length, notwithstanding all Difficulties, <i>Furtado</i> sail&rsquo;d
from <i>Goa</i> with six Galeons, eighteen Galiots, and one Galley,
with the King&rsquo;s Orders, and in his Name those of the Viceroy
<i>Arias de Saldania</i>, to fight the <i>Dutch</i>, and any other
Enemy, and to proceed to <i>Sunda</i>, to chastize that King, and the
Rebels in <i>Java</i>. He was directed to place Garrisons there, and
having <span class="marginnote"><i>Disabled by Storms.</i></span>
settled the Affairs of <i>India</i>, to proceed to the <i>Moluccos</i>.
They went out with good Hearts to undertake that Work, but were
hinder&rsquo;d by Storms and Tempests. In the Gulph of <i>Ceylon</i>,
he lost the Galley, and seventeen Galiots that were under the Conduct
of <i>Francis de Sousa</i>, and <i>Andrew Roiz</i>, and in them the
greatest Strength he had to compass his Designs. He was three whole
Years without any Succours to proceed on his Enterprize. At
<i>Malaca</i> he recruited the best he could; and in <i>December</i>,
1601, Steering his Course for <i>Sunda</i>, relying on the Succours he
expected from the King of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href=
"#pb187" name="pb187">187</a>]</span><i>Palimbam</i>, in <i>Java</i>,
suppos&rsquo;d to be our Friend and Confederate; but he was deceived,
for that Infidel was so far from espousing our Party, that he had taken
up with the King of <i>Sunda</i>, whom he intended, and afterwards
actually did succour with 30000 Men. This did not dismay
<i>Furtado</i>, but he sail&rsquo;d on towards <i>Sunda</i>, referring
the Punishment of the King of <i>Palimbam</i> <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Sails for</i> Sunda.</span> to another Time: There, on
the Bar, he discover&rsquo;d seven <i>Dutch</i> Ships, which he
pursu&rsquo;d, tho&rsquo; to little purpose, they being excellent
Sailers. However the Galeon Commanded by <i>Thomas de Sousa
Aronches</i>, fought five of them, killing many <i>Dutch</i>, without
losing one Man; but her Rigging was torn, and she could not board the
Enemy, who fled, drawing our Ships after them in such a manner, that
<i>Furtado</i> could not possibly recover the Bar, tho&rsquo; he
anchor&rsquo;d in a Road, from whence he might have return&rsquo;d to
the Port.</p>
<p>This was a special Providence, for the Enemy did not seem
dispos&rsquo;d to stand, and they had already been upon both Bars; and
therefore reflecting <span class="marginnote"><i>Arrives at</i>
Amboyna.</span> on the Tears, and Groans of the Commanders, and
Christians at <i>Amboyna</i>, he directed his Course towards those
Islands, where he arriv&rsquo;d on the 10th of <i>February</i> without
being detain&rsquo;d by some Victories he gain&rsquo;d in his Way. The
Natives and those in the Fort were alarm&rsquo;d, believing they had
been Enemies, but the Admiral giving a Signal, they knew the Christian
Fleet. The Joy spread abroad, and the Shore was cover&rsquo;d with
People expressing it. <i>Furtado</i> first apply&rsquo;d himself to
repair the Fort, and refit the Ships. He also built four Ships, two
Galiots, and twelve <i>Carcoas</i>. Then he set out, without losing
Time, to make War on the <i>Itos</i>, and other Towns <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Subdues the</i> Itos.</span> that had rebell&rsquo;d
against the Fort, sending <i>Joseph Pinto</i>, with 200
<i>Portugueses</i> by Land. The Fleet sail&rsquo;d round the Island,
and lay a Month in the Bay call&rsquo;d <i>Bacacio</i>. <i>Texeyra</i>,
Commander in Chief of the Fort, went before, with a good Number of
<i>Carcoas</i>, to reduce some rebellious Towns, especially those which
are on the Mountains call&rsquo;d <i>Gunos</i>, where there are
excellent sweet Waters, and large Woods of Orange Trees. These Towns
acknowledge their Fault, and came to make their Submission. Seven or
<span class="marginnote"><i>The</i> Gunos <i>submit</i>.</span> Eight
of the principal Men came from each Town. Every Town brought a Flag,
and three large valuable Basons of bright Metal, and in them a little
Earth, with Branches of Clove-Trees in Blossom, in Token that they
deliver&rsquo;d up the Land, with the most precious of its Product.
Some brought Goats, and Hens, and such Fruit as their Country afforded
to denote the same.</p>
<p><i>Furtado</i> knew there was a private Alliance between the Rebels
of <i>Amboyna</i> and the <i>Dutch</i>, and that ten Ships were to come
to take that Fort, <span class="marginnote"><i>Ten</i> Dutch <i>Ships
at</i> Amboyna.</span> and the other we had left us at <i>Amboyna</i>.
They were so deeply engag&rsquo;d in this Contract, that those at
<i>Sunda</i>, seeing <i>Furtado</i> set sail towards those Parts, they
did the same, and on the 10th of <i>March</i>, the ten Ships
appear&rsquo;d in Sight of the Islands, three of them coming on and
treating with the Natives; yet for fear of us, they stood off to the
Island <i>Burro</i>, and the other seven to <i>Banda</i>, to sail over
to the <i>Moluccos</i>. All this was known to <i>Furtado</i> by good
Intelligence, besides that he receiv&rsquo;d from <i>F. Lewis
Fernandez</i>, Rector of the Society of <span class=
"ex"><i>JESUS</i></span>, who was newly come from <i>Tydore</i>, with
Letters from that King, and the Christians residing there, bidding him
welcome, and pressing that he would come to their Assistance;
<span class="marginnote"><i>Three of them at</i> Ternate.</span>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name=
"pb188">188</a>]</span>because three of the seven Ships that
escap&rsquo;d from him at <i>Sunda</i>, were together at
<i>Ternate</i>. He was also inform&rsquo;d, that those Ships, had found
out a Way to relieve those Forts, passing between <i>Borneo</i> and
<i>Macossar</i>, <span class="marginnote"><i>A new Passage to the</i>
Molucco.</span> which is a shorter Cut by a Year; and that they were
fortifying <i>Ternate</i> where they would not suffer the <i>Dutch</i>
to leave them, but oblig&rsquo;d them to stay and ingage in the War
they expected. <i>Furtado</i> follow&rsquo;d that in <i>Amboyna</i>,
daily reducing some Towns that had revolted. The Inhabitants of
<i>Rosatelo</i>, built on an Eminence, and well fortify&rsquo;d
discovering our Ships, <span class="marginnote"><i>People of Rosatelo
burn their Town.</i></span> and <i>Carcoas</i>, set fire to all their
Goods, and then to their Houses, and fled to a high Mountain, where
their Wives and Children were before. The Way up to it was by tying to
the Trees certain <i>Rotas</i>, which are slender tough Canes, that may
be knotted like Ropes, a slow and almost useless Hold, which
render&rsquo;d the Mountain never the less inaccessible. Yet our Men
making their Way thro&rsquo; Clefts, attain&rsquo;d the Top two days
after. The Rebels perceiving they were lost, came to receive the
Conquerors with <span class="marginnote"><i>Submit.</i></span> white
Flags, but the King, not daring to trust to that Security, fled to
remoter Parts.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>People of</i> Ito <i>fly to the
mountain.</i></span> The Infidels of <i>Ito</i>, puff&rsquo;d up with
the <i>Dutch</i> Supplies they expected, made no Doubt of routing the
Christians, as soon as they landed; but perceiving they were
disappointed of the Succour of the ten Ships, which sail&rsquo;d by
without staying, and that <i>Rosatelo</i> was reduc&rsquo;d; yet they
were not quite dejected, but committed their Safety to the Strength and
Tops of the Mountains. They abandon&rsquo;d their chief City, properly
call&rsquo;d <i>Ito</i>. and the Fort there erected by the
<i>Dutch</i>, retiring with all their Families to the highest and most
impregnable Part of the Country call&rsquo;d <i>Nao</i> and
<i>Bemnao</i>, being two Rocks, one above another, like the Round-Tops
in a Ship one over the other; whence the Shore appears near at Hand
tho&rsquo; <span class="marginnote"><i>Nao strong place, whither the
Rebels fled.</i></span> half a League distant, by Reason of the
Windings of the Ways. <i>Nao</i> is all encompass&rsquo;d with upright
Rocks, with pleasant Planes below. There are three Ways to get up to
it, but all of them so difficult, that the very Lizards can scarce
climb it. On these three Passes they threw up double Trenches, with
strong Ramparts, and a good Number of Brass Sakers, and Demy-Falconets
to secure them. At each of them was a considerable Number of Men, with
their Colours flying, and all Sorts of offensive and defensive Arms,
wherewith the <i>Dutch</i> have furnish&rsquo;d those Southern Seas.
The greatest Danger threatned was from a great Number of mighty Stones,
or Pieces of Rocks, which being roul&rsquo;d down from such a Height
can bear down and destroy an Army. All the Enemy&rsquo;s Power was now
reduc&rsquo;d to this single Place, and the Town standing on the first
of the <span class="marginnote"><i>Pleasant Country of</i> Nao,
<i>and</i> Bemnao.</span> two Rocks, being built on a large round Spot
it forms, like an <i>European</i> City with good large Houses, after
their Manner. All the Country about beautify&rsquo;d with Clove Trees,
like our Olive Trees, but with greater Heads. Among which there ran up
Branches of the Male and Female Trees, and underneath all Sorts of
thorny Plants, Orange, Lemmon, Citron and <i>Zamboa</i> Trees, with
six, or eight Springs, each of them gushing out curious Streams of
Water. All the Mountain look&rsquo;d like a delicious pleasure House
and Garden. On the Top of it appear&rsquo;d the Town of <i>Bemnao</i>,
which signifyes, the Son of <i>Nao</i>, exceeding the other in Number
of Houses, and Extent of Woods. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189"

<p>The General came to this Place on <i>Palm-Sunday</i>, order&rsquo;d
a Trench to be <span class="marginnote">Furtado <i>encamps at</i>
Bemnao.</span> cast up, and Tents to be pitch&rsquo;d, for a Defence
against the Sun, and the Rain, which sometimes falls unexpected. He
commanded an Enemy <i>Amboynese</i>, that had fallen into his Hands,
attended by some Christians, to go enquire into the Designs of the
People of <i>Ito</i>, and to guide the Way. When they were come within
hearing, and had deliver&rsquo;d their Message, <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Haughty Answer of</i> the Itos.</span> the Infidels
answer&rsquo;d, <i>That they were the King of</i> Ternate&rsquo;s
<i>Subjects</i>, <i>and own&rsquo;d none but him</i>. <i>That they
would trade with the</i> Dutch<i>, and all other Nations they thought
fit. That they would also sell Clove to the</i> Spaniards<i>; but that
the King of</i> Spain <i>had a very long Neck.</i> Having
return&rsquo;d this Answer, they began to fire the Cannon. Our Men were
forc&rsquo;d to put up the Affront, and pass by their Fury; but the
General regarding neither, order&rsquo;d a Captain, on <i>Monday</i>,
to view the Situation of the Place; because his Soldiers had gone up
disorderly to their Trenches, and been repuls&rsquo;d with Shot, and
throwing of Stones, which made them retire down the Mountain with many
wounded. The next Night he sent 200 Men, to possess themselves of a
Mount that overlook&rsquo;d the Enemies Trenches. They did so, and as
soon as the Day appear&rsquo;d, our Musketiers pour&rsquo;d in
<span class="marginnote">Portugueses <i>gain Ground</i>.</span> their
Volleys of Shot, firing at the same Time with two Drakes, they had
carry&rsquo;d up with a Design to cast up another Trench, and thus they
put the Enemy to Rout. The Trench was thrown up, and the next Night
they remov&rsquo;d the Drakes to it, drawing nearer, to make the
greater Slaughter. <i>Gonzalo Vaz de Castello-Branco</i> commanded at
this Pass. The Men here that Night talk&rsquo;d with the
besieg&rsquo;d, and assur&rsquo;d them, they would take their Fort the
next Night, as they actually did.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>They <span class="corr" id="xd21e22188"
title="Source: at-atack">attack</span> the Enemies Fort.</i></span> On
<i>Wednesday</i> Morning the General order&rsquo;d the Drums to beat to
Arms, to go up himself to the Hill where his Men were, leaving
<i>Trajano Ruiz de Castello-Branco</i> below, with 50 Men, to guard the
Camp; but without any Design of attacking the Fort that Day; but only
to order the Men, and assign them their Posts. Whilst he was concerting
this Affair with his Officers, <i>Gonzalo Vaz</i> came to them with a
dangerous Shot in one of the Calves of his Legs, and five other Wounds
running Blood. The Soldiers were incens&rsquo;d, at the Sight of him,
and signify&rsquo;d they would fall on. It was given out, where the
General was, that the Victorious Enemy was falling upon our Drakes, and
Posts; and he improving Necessity cry&rsquo;d out, with a loud Voice,
<i>Santiago</i>, that is, <i>S. James</i>, the Cry given by the
<i>Spaniards</i> when they fall on. The Soldiers were so
encourag&rsquo;d by this Cry, that they immediately gave the Assault,
with much Fury and Alacrity, climbing those smooth Rocks, upon their
Hands and Feet: The Barbarians Drums and Bag-Pipes rattled in their
Ears, and the Noise of their Cannon and small Shot eccho&rsquo;d among
all the Rocks. The Enemy threw Stones, which wounded, and knock&rsquo;d
down our Men, and many tumbled, without being able to help themselves:
Some single Stones carry&rsquo;d two or three Men down the Side of a
Hill, till they stopp&rsquo;d at some Tree. A Captain was stunn&rsquo;d
with a Pebble, tho&rsquo; he receiv&rsquo;d it on a Steel Buckler; but
he soon recover&rsquo;d, and was seen upon the Enemies Works. The Cries
and Shouts rent the Air. Many tumbling down forc&rsquo;d out the sharp
Pointed Stakes that were drove into the Ground; and presently after, as
if they had flown, were seen Fighting above. Those who were left to
guard <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name=
"pb190">190</a>]</span>the Camp, look&rsquo;d on with Emulation. Among
them a Religious Man of <span class="marginnote"><i>The Fort
taken.</i></span> the Order of <i>S. Dominick</i>, fell on his Knees to
say the Litany, all the Men answering, and God heard him, for before it
was ended, they saw our Colours display&rsquo;d above, and the Enemies
cast down, the Fort and Works being Demolish&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>A brave Christian, who carry&rsquo;d the foremost of our Colours,
was laid hold of by an <i>Amboynese</i>, yet he, tho&rsquo; shot
thro&rsquo; the Body with a Musket-Ball, whereof he soon after
Dy&rsquo;d, defended them bravely. However, notwithstanding his
Resistance, and that his Captain came to his Succour, the Infidel
carry&rsquo;d off a Part of the Staff, which was recover&rsquo;d when
the Victory was <span class="marginnote">Amboyneses <i>abandon their
highest Fort</i>.</span> gain&rsquo;d. The <i>Amboyneses</i>, seeing
their Works taken, and their Colours dragg&rsquo;d about, withdrew to
the upper-Part, leaving only three Men behind them, who dy&rsquo;d
Fighting, with honourable Obstinacy. They did not fortifie themselves
in that Place, but abandoning their Town and Goods, and slipping down
Precipices, and upright Heights with Ropes, made their Escapes; and
though they burnt some of their Goods, yet many of value
remain&rsquo;d. The General gave Order for curing of the wounded Men,
which were above 200, besides those run through by the sharp Stakes
pitch&rsquo;d all about the Field.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Towns submit.</i></span> The gaining
of this Victory did so discourage all the Islanders, that they
refus&rsquo;d to take up Arms, or hazard an Engagement. Nine Towns
submitted at once, the next day, and the Territory about did the same.
The General came down Victorious, and erected Arbours in those
Delightful Woods, with an Altar, on which Mass was sung on Easter-Day,
and all the Office of the Church, with much Solemnity, in Thanksgiving,
assigning the Sovereignty to that Lord, who grants, or takes away
Victory, according <span class="marginnote">Dutch <i>Fort
raz&rsquo;d</i><span class="corr" id="xd21e22243" title=
"Not in source">.</span></span> to his secret Judgements. The
<i>Dutch</i> Fort was raz&rsquo;d, where, in several Places, were to be
seen Escutcheons, with the Arms of Count <i>Maurice</i>. The King of
<i>Ito</i> came and submitted himself; his Name, whilst an Idolater,
was <i>Talere</i>, afterwards <i>Don Melchior</i>, for he was a
Renegado Christian, and fled at the taking of <i>Rosatelo</i>. He
deliver&rsquo;d himself up, as also a famous <i>Caziz</i> he brought
with him, who was a Man of much Reputation among them.</p>
<p>To this Victory <i>Furtado</i> resolv&rsquo;d to add those he
expected at <i>Veranula</i>, <span class="marginnote">Veranula <i>City
describ&rsquo;d</i>.</span> a large City, and Neighbouring Island. He
sail&rsquo;d from <i>Amboyna</i> with all the Fleet, and arriv&rsquo;d
at <i>Veranula</i>, and the City of the same Name, which is populous,
and its Territory the most fruitful in Clove of any in those Parts. It
is built along the shore on a high and upright Rock, which look&rsquo;d
like a Wall, with Towers, and Stories. The Houses are high
Roof&rsquo;d, with Galleries. There is a Mosque that has three Isles,
with a stately Room to read the <i>Alcoran</i> in. Within the City was
the <i>Dutch</i> Fort, conveniently seated, built of Stone, round, and
cover&rsquo;d. Beyond that was also another Stone Fort, with several
salliant Angles, Ravelins, and Guerites. This belong&rsquo;d to the
King of <i>Ternate</i>, who was Tyrant of that Part of <i>Veranula</i>.
As soon as our Fleet anchor&rsquo;d before the City, the Prime Men of
it came to acquaint the General, That they were willing to submit, but
knew not how to do it, for Fear of the <i>Ternates</i>; and therefore
desir&rsquo;d he would let them assemble their Council, and they would
return the next Day with their Answer. <i>Furtado</i> granted their
Request, sending two <i>Amboyneses</i> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb191" href="#pb191" name="pb191">191</a>]</span>of Note along with
them. They return&rsquo;d no Answer, but fled, <span class=
"marginnote"><i>People of</i> Veranula <i>fly</i>.</span> not daring to
stand the Fury of those who came Victorious. They fir&rsquo;d a Gun for
a Signal of what they were doing, and the General being assur&rsquo;d
of their Flight, order&rsquo;d the Men to land and plunder the City.
The Inhabitants had before secur&rsquo;d the best of their Effects, and
yet in some Houses they found above the value of 30000 Crowns, and in
others less, besides many Goods of value; abundance of Brass Drakes and
Muskets; <i>China</i> Ware, and Silks; <i>Dutch</i> Glasses, and great
Store of Royal-Cloves. <span class="marginnote">Veranula
<i>plunder&rsquo;d and burnt</i>.</span> After plundering the City,
they set fire to it, and it burnt for some Days. The <i>Dutch</i> and
<i>Ternatese</i> Forts were raz&rsquo;d. The General was inform&rsquo;d
by some Prisoners, that the People of <i>Veranula</i>, had expected
mighty Succours against him from the <i>Dutch</i> Ships that were seen;
and that there were aboard 100 Men to Garrison <i>Viranula</i>, and 100
more for the Fort he had demolish&rsquo;d at <i>Ito</i>. Some of our
Men pursu&rsquo;d the <i>Ternates</i> as far as <i>Lacidecavello</i>, a
Town where they imbark&rsquo;d on many Vessels, for <span class="corr"
id="xd21e22359" title="Source: theit">their</span> own Island.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Mamala <i>City submits with
others</i>.</span> After this, the City <i>Mamala</i> sent to make its
Submission, and many others follow&rsquo;d its Example. <i>Furtado</i>
having concluded this Affair, resolv&rsquo;d to return to
<i>Amboyna</i>, and being upon his Departure, <i>Francis de Sousa
Teve</i> came to him, with ten <i>Portugueses</i>, who had been, not
long before, taken by the <i>Dutch</i> Ships. He had met at
<i>Banda</i> the five Ships <i>Furtado</i> found at <i>Sunda</i>, and
here gave him some important Intelligence, showing how much he would
find the Seas, in his Way to the <i>Moluccos</i>, infested by those
Northern Sailers. The Commander in Chief of the <i>Dutch</i> made very
much of <i>Francis de Sousa</i>, dismissing him with Arms and
Provisions for his Voyage, but at the Price of 500 Crowns, paid for him
and his Companions, by some Heathen Towns in the Island; to whom
<i>Furtado</i>, without any Delay, made good the whole Sum. The
<i>Dutch</i> General writ very civilly to <i>Furtado</i>, desiring he
would use his Men well, as he would do by the <i>Spaniards</i> he met
with. <i>Furtado</i> return&rsquo;d an Answer, no less Courteous, and
sent him a <i>Dutch</i> Youth, who had been Prisoner at
<i>Ternate</i>.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The conquer&rsquo;d submit, and give
Hostages.</i></span> Having reduc&rsquo;d these Islands, <i>Furtado</i>
appointed a Day for the Governors of them to come and swear Fealty to
our King, that he might save Time, and follow the Course of his
Victories. They came with much State, and Submission; and to secure
their future Behaviour, and their new promis&rsquo;d Fidelity,
deliver&rsquo;d to the General a considerable Number of Youths, being
the Sons of the Prime Men, as Hostages. Peace, and the general Pardon,
were celebrated with Rejoycings. The Preaching of the Gospel was again
exercis&rsquo;d with entire Liberty, and many Idolaters, and
<i>Mahometans</i> were converted. Other Provinces came to acknowledge
the Conqueror; without expecting the Chance of War. <i>Furtado</i> at
<i>Amboyna</i> prepar&rsquo;d for the Expedition against the
<i>Moluccos</i>.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>King of</i> Ternate&rsquo;s
<i>Preparations</i>.</span> Those who fled to <i>Ternate</i>, gave an
Account of the Loss of the Towns and Forts that King had been
possess&rsquo;d of at <i>Amboyna</i>; and that the General
<i>Furtado</i> openly declar&rsquo;d he was making Preparations against
those Islands, and grew stronger upon his Success. The King slighted
not this Intelligence, but immediately strengthened his Fleet, and his
Forts, and call&rsquo;d in the <i>Javaneses</i> and <i>Mindanaos</i>,
to be in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name=
"pb192">192</a>]</span>readiness upon any Attack. Amidst the Noise of
War, and his Treaties with the <i>Dutch</i> for maintaining of it, he
found Leasure to seek his Satisfaction; concluding a Match with his
Queen <i>Celicaya</i>, who follow&rsquo;d him in all his Troubles, even
when he last fled from his Kingdom. She was very Young, and so
Beautiful, that all the <i>Indian</i> Kings courted her for their Wife,
and sent to demand her of the <i>Sangiack</i> of <i>Motiel</i>, her
Father; who gave her to him of <i>Ternate</i>, as the greatest, most
potent, and respected. <span class="marginnote"><i>His
Marriage</i>.</span> The Time for the Nuptials being come, when the
Bride was brought to <i>Ternate</i>, attended by her Father, Kindred,
Brothers-in-law, and many Troops of arm&rsquo;d Men, she was
receiv&rsquo;d with the Noise of Cannon, Musick, and other Instruments
us&rsquo;d in their Festivals and Solemnities. These <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Queen</i> Celicaya&rsquo;s <i>great Beauty</i>.</span>
lasted many Days, with Profusion; but the most pleasing Object, was the
Presence of <i>Celicaya</i>, her <span class="corr" id="xd21e22514"
title="Source: extradiordinary">extraordinary</span> Grace, which drew
the Eyes, and Affections of all Men, temper&rsquo;d with a Sort of
Affability, which encourag&rsquo;d all that convers&rsquo;d with her.
This Quality very often gave Occasion to suspect her Husband&rsquo;s
Reputation, and were not this History confined to such Things as really
relate to the Conquest, it might afford us a large Field to treat of
the Gentleness of her Disposition, her Love Intrigues, and
uncontroulable Power over the Affections, even of those who were most
wrong&rsquo;d; which are spoken of at large in several Discourses and
Relations.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Furtado <i>sends for Succours to the</i>
Philippine <i>Islands</i>.</span> The Exigencies of the Time, and
necessity oblig&rsquo;d the General <i>Furtado</i> to press for the
Succours, which were providing for him in the <i>Philippine</i>
Islands. <i>Amboyna</i> is 200 Leagues from the nearest of them, and
that 200 more from <i>Manila</i>, he sent thither <i>F. Andrew
Pereyra</i>, a Jesuit, and Captain <i>Antony Brito Fogaza</i>, in
<i>May 1602</i>. They arriv&rsquo;d at <i>Cebu</i> on the 25th of
<i>July</i>, sail&rsquo;d thence for <i>Manila</i> on the 6th of
<i>August</i>, and came to that City on the 5th of <i>September</i>.
<i>Don Pedro de Acunna</i> was well pleas&rsquo;d to see them, asking
particularly concerning all the Proceedings of the General
<i>Furtado</i>, wherein he was very curious, or rather generously
emulous, and he having in his Letters referr&rsquo;d himself to their
Relation, they gave it him at large, and perform&rsquo;d the Duty of
their Embassy, each according to his Profession. <i>Don Pedro</i> did
not delay their Business; but call&rsquo;d a Council of War, wherein it
was resolv&rsquo;d, that the Succours he desir&rsquo;d should be sent
<i>Furtado</i>, tho&rsquo; they were forc&rsquo;d to comply with the
Difficulties the Country then labour&rsquo;d under. Upon this
Determination he sent away to <span class="marginnote"><i>Succours sent
from the</i> Philippines <i>to</i> Furtado.</span> the Provinces of the
<i>Pintados</i>, ordering Capt. <i>John Xuarez Gallinato</i>, who
commanded there, to furnish all Things necessary for the Enterprize;
and that he, with the best disciplin&rsquo;d Infantry, should leave
<i>Cebu</i>, and repair to the Town of <i>Arevalo</i>, the place
appointed for the Fleet to rendezvouz. <i>Gallinato</i> did so, and
sent a Ship to <i>Oton</i>, to take in as much as it could of the
Succours. It arriv&rsquo;d at <i>Oton</i> on the 28th of
<i>October</i>; and that same Day <i>Don Pedro</i> set out from
<i>Manila</i> for the <i>Pintados</i>, in Order to hasten the fitting
out of the Fleet by his Presence, tho&rsquo; it was then almost ready
at <i>Oton</i>, where he arriv&rsquo;d on the 13th of <i>November</i>,
and he was of such a mettled Temper, that never regarding the
Expeditions of <i>Xolo</i> and <i>Mindanao</i>, or that the Natives of
those Islands were spread about in Troops among those of the
<i>Pintados</i>, robbing and murdering his Majesty&rsquo;s Subjects, he
gather&rsquo;d the Supplies, and deliver&rsquo;d them to <i>John Xuarez
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name=
"pb193">193</a>]</span>Gallinato</i>, appointing him General, and
Commander in Chief for this Expedition.</p>
<p>As soon as the General <i>Furtado</i> had sent away for Succours to
<i>Manila</i>, after chastising and garrisoning of <i>Veranula</i> and
<i>Amboyna</i>, he set sail for the <i>Molucco</i> Islands, with five
Galeons, four Galliots, and 12 <i>Carcoas</i>, carrying his Victorious
Men; but in those Seas Disasters are so frequent, that neither the Joy
of their late Successes, nor the Refreshment receiv&rsquo;d after their
Victories, appear&rsquo;d in their Countenances. He arriv&rsquo;d at
<i>Ternate</i> <span class="marginnote"><i>Furtado</i> sails by
<i>Ternate</i> to <i>Tydore</i>.</span> with this Fleet, on the 10th of
<i>August</i>; but he only look&rsquo;d on that Island, and proceeded
to <i>Tydore</i>: There he view&rsquo;d the Fort, encourag&rsquo;d the
Soldiers in it, and made use of that King&rsquo;s Person and Interest,
as Prudence directed; for that Prince, tho&rsquo; he labours by Words
to convince us of his Friendship and Fidelity, does not confirm it by
his Actions; but rather leaves us dubious, when he most endeavours to
perswade.</p>
<p><i>Furtado</i> left the Galeons at <i>Tydore</i>, and with the other
Vessels that row&rsquo;d, went six Leagues thence, to the Island of
<i>Machian</i>, then Subject to the <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Machian</i> Island submits to <i>Furtado</i>.</span>
King of <i>Ternate</i>, but so weary of that Vassalage, that as soon as
our Fleet appear&rsquo;d, the Governours flock&rsquo;d down to the
Port, attended by the Natives, with their Wives and Children, and such
Gifts as came next to Hand, as also some Colours, which they laid at
<i>Furtado</i>&rsquo;s Feet, submitting themselves, and delivering up
their Country. The Men landed in peaceable Manner, amidst the usual
Noise of Bagpipes and Basons; and the <i>Portugueses</i> having in vain
sought after some <i>Dutch</i> Men, who chose rather to secure
themselves by Flight, than to trust to the General&rsquo;s good Nature,
were inform&rsquo;d that they were gone over to <i>Ternate</i>. A view
having <span class="marginnote"><i>Dutch</i> fly to
<i>Ternate</i>.</span> been taken of the Island, <i>Furtado</i> erected
a Fort with all possible Expedition, in the most convenient Place. When
finish&rsquo;d according to the Rules of Fortification, he put into it
a Captain with 50 Men, whom he left well arm&rsquo;d and provided, and
with them a light Vessel, call&rsquo;d a <i>Galizabra</i>. Then he
return&rsquo;d himself, with the Rest of the fleet, to <i>Tydore</i>,
where he joyn&rsquo;d all his Ships, repair&rsquo;d them, and set out
for <i>Ternate</i> to the Port of <i>Talangame</i>, where he
anchor&rsquo;d, and lay from the End of <i>October</i> to the middle of
<i>February</i>, when the Succours from <i>Manila</i> came.</p>
<p>Some accuse him of lying still very long without attempting any
thing; <span class="marginnote">Furtado <i>accus&rsquo;d</i>.</span>
saying, he let slip the Opportunities, without cutting off the Enemies
Provisions, or ravaging their Country, when he might have subdu&rsquo;d
them by that Means alone, without firing a Shot. However, when we have
before us the Actions of such great Commanders, it is safer to judge
they had some sufficient unknown Reason for what they did, than to
attribute it to their Fault. Most certain it is, That being
inform&rsquo;d of a Fleet of the Enemies of 22 <i>Carcoas</i>, which
was not far from the Island <i>Machian</i>, he lost no Time, but
putting 172 <i>Portugueses</i>, of the chosen Men of his Fleet, into 18
<i>Carcoas</i>, under an able Commander, he sent them to find out the
Infidels. But tho&rsquo; the Soldiers were so haughty, that every one
undertook to fight six <i>Carcoas</i>, yet every Officer was for
commanding all the Rest, and <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Portugueses</i> <span class="corr" id="xd21e22778"
title="Source: baflled">baffled</span> through their Pride.</span> thus
Want of Discipline snatch&rsquo;d the Victory out of their Hands. The
Enemy pass&rsquo;d by, and they look&rsquo;d on, without firing a Gun.
The Barbarian Fleet, observing their Disorder, stood about nimbly, and
pouring in a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name=
"pb194">194</a>]</span>Volley upon the <i>Portugueses</i>, took a
<i>Carcoa</i>, with fourteen Men in it, whom they slew, in Sight of
their Companions, and it was good Fortune that they did not follow
their Stroke. This occasion&rsquo;d the General&rsquo;s erecting the
Fort at <i>Machian</i>; whilst the King of <i>Ternate</i>
strengthen&rsquo;d his, with the Assistance of 20 <i>Hollanders</i>,
making good Use of the Leisure of eight Months given him by
<i>Furtado</i>. He then cast up Works, and provided Engines, as he did
afterwards in the Sight of our Camp.</p>
<p>When the Fleet was all assembled at the <i>Philippine</i> Islands,
the Ammunition and Provisions were deliver&rsquo;d to <i>Gallinato</i>,
by the Judges and King&rsquo;s <span class="marginnote"><i>The Succours
sent by</i> Don Pedro de Acunna.</span> Attorney of the Sovereign
Court, being 1000 Bushels of clean Rice, 300 Bullocks for Flesh; 200
Jars of Wine; 80 Quintals, or hundred Weight of Nails, Hooks, Hinges,
and other Iron Work; 40 of Powder; 300 <i>Ilocos</i> Blankets; 700
Yards of <i>Spanish</i> Woollen Cloth; 100 Needles for Sails; 30 Jars
of Oil; and for the Complement of Men, 200 Soldiers, 165 of them heavy
Harquebusiers, and the other, 35 light Musquetiers; 22 Seamen; some
Pilots; one Master; three Gunners of S. <i>Potenciana</i>, and 20
Grummets. The whole Expence hereof amounting to 22260 Pieces of Eight a
Month. The Governour and Sovereign Court having done thus much, they
requir&rsquo;d <i>F. Andrew Pereyra</i>, and Captain <i>Brito</i>, to
go with that Supply, which was then in readiness, under
<i>Gallinato</i>, with the Colours, and Captains <i>Christopher
Villagra</i>, and <i>John Fernandes de Torres</i>. The Company
belonging to Captain <i>Don Thomas Bravo</i>, the Governour&rsquo;s
Nephew, and Son to his Brother <i>Don Garcia</i>, staid behind, but the
Captain went himself, and serv&rsquo;d honourably in the Expedition.
The Foot embark&rsquo;d on the Ship <i>S. Potenciana</i>, and the
Frigats <i>S. Antony</i>, <i>S. Sebastian</i>, <i>S. Bonaventure</i>,
and <i>S. Francis</i>. They set sail from the Port of <i>Yloilo</i>, on
the 20th of <i>January</i>, 1603, and arriv&rsquo;d at that of
<i>Caldera</i>, in <i>Mindanao</i>, on the 25th; where receiving some
Intelligence of the Enemy, they continued till the 28th. Then they
saild towards the <i>Moluccos</i>, and on the 7th of <i>February</i>
descry&rsquo;d the Island of <i>Siao</i>, and the next Morning, by
Break of Day, that <span class="marginnote">S. Antony <i>Frigat cast
away</i>.</span> of <i>Toalan</i>, four Leagues from it. There the
Frigat <i>S. Antony</i> was cast away, on a Shoal of that Island, which
discompos&rsquo;d all the Squadron. <i>Gallinato</i> took Care to save
the Men. He sent Captain <i>Villagra</i>, who brought them off, with
the Arms and Guns; the rest was swallowed by the Sea.</p>
<p>They held on their Voyage, and on the 13th of <i>February</i>
discover&rsquo;d the Island of <i>Ternate</i>. On the 14th they
arriv&rsquo;d at <i>Tydore</i>, where they were inform&rsquo;d of the
coming of <i>Andrew Furtado</i>; and therefore stay&rsquo;d but a
<span class="marginnote">Gallinato <i>from</i> Manila <i>joyns</i>
Furtado.</span> short Time to refresh themselves, being earnest to joyn
him. Setting forward with a fair Wind, they came to <i>Ternate</i>, and
enter&rsquo;d the Port of <i>Talangame</i>, a League from the Fort, on
the 16th of the aforesaid Month. The Fleets saluted one another in
friendly Manner, and the Generals did the like, giving one another an
Account of their Strength, Transactions, and all other Particulars till
that Time. The Discourse falling out of one Thing into another, came to
contesting; for <i>Gallinato</i> affirm&rsquo;d, That the Enemies
Provisions ought to have been cut off, by ordering our <i>Carcoas</i>
to sail round the Island, which was in great Want of them, and could be
reliev&rsquo;d by the Opportunity he had given. <i>Furtado</i>
alledg&rsquo;d other Reasons to defend himself. It was thought
convenient before they landed, to take <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb195" href="#pb195" name="pb195">195</a>]</span>a View of the Enemies
Fort, to which Purpose, the Captains, <i>Christopher Villagra</i>, and
<i>Gonzalo Sequeyra</i> were appointed to make up to it in a
<i>Carcoa</i>, with a white Flag, as it were to speak with the King,
and propose Peace and Conditions.</p>
<p>Those two Officers drew near, the Enemy met them, and understanding
what they came about, sent to acquaint the King. He answer&rsquo;d he
could not give them Audience that Day, but they might return the next.
They returning accordingly, the Inhabitants of the City came out to
meet them, <span class="marginnote"><i>Two Captains sent to the City
of</i> Ternate.</span> and among them <i>Cachil Sugui</i>, <i>Cachil
Gogo</i>, and <i>Cachil Quipate</i>, the King&rsquo;s Uncles, who went
back to tell him, that those Captains were come by his Highness&rsquo;s
Command. This Message was brought him at Nine a Clock in the Morning,
and tho&rsquo; he was close by the City, the Answer came not till four
in the Afternoon, and was, That unless <i>Furtado</i>, or
<i>Gallinato</i> came, he would not speak with any other; but that the
Captains that were come might treat with his Officers, and he would
stand by, and ratify what they should conclude. The <i>Spaniards</i>
having receiv&rsquo;d this Answer, and their Design being to view the
Fort, Captain <i>Villagra</i> <span class="marginnote">Villagra
<i>views the Fort.</i></span> set his Resolution, and pretending some
Occasion, went into the Thicket, whence he observ&rsquo;d all that
could be seen on that Side, more nicely than could have been expected
in so short a Time. They return&rsquo;d to the Fleet, and gave the
General an Account of all they knew.</p>
<p>In fine, they landed, and then again <i>Gallinato</i> intreated
<i>Furtado</i>, to <span class="marginnote"><i>The Forces
land.</i></span> send out the light Vessels a cruising, to cut off the
Enemies Supplies; and those which went out upon his Request, sped so
well, that they met a plentiful and strong Reinforcement of Men and
Provisions, in two <i>Junks</i> and a large <i>Chiampan</i>, which they
took, killing and taking the Men, who were Numerous and well
arm&rsquo;d. They continu&rsquo;d to round the Island, encourag&rsquo;d
by this first Success, and by that Means cut off all Succours. The
Enemy began to want, sicken and dye. They fed on Herbs, and other
slight Dyet; and many, but particularly Women, not being able to endure
Hunger, <span class="marginnote"><i>Famine at</i> Ternate.</span> fled
confidently, tho&rsquo; compell&rsquo;d by Necessity, to our Camp; and
the rest would have done the same if they could.</p>
<p>On the 27th of <i>February</i>, <i>Furtado</i> took a Review of his
Men on the <span class="marginnote"><i>Christians
review&rsquo;d.</i></span> Enemies Shore, where our Ships were at
Anchor. <i>Gallinato</i> said, he was much troubled to see it, because
in his Opinion, they were not fit even to make that Show, most of them
being Boys, sick of the Distemper they call <i>Berber</i>, unskillful
at their Fire-arms, and very few of them had Muskets, but only little
Fowling-Pieces; so that all seem&rsquo;d to forebode ill Success. The
whole Number of them was 420 Soldiers, divided into four Companies. The
next Day, the <i>Spanish</i> Infantry of the <i>Philippine</i> Islands
pass&rsquo;d Muster, in the same Place, before <i>Furtado</i> and his
Officers. <i>Don Thomas</i> led them in Armour, and with a Pike in his
Hand, with all the Musquetiers in the Van. After him the other
Companies in Order, according to Seniority. They all form&rsquo;d three
Bodies, being Men of Experience, well equipp&rsquo;d, orderly, and of
such Valour as soon after appear&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>A Council was held, about landing, on the first of <i>March</i>,
where the <span class="marginnote"><i>Consuls about landing.</i></span>
General declar&rsquo;d by Word of Mouth, saying he never did it in
Writing, That he had lain so long, almost idle, wholly depending on the
Succour that was come, and that since <i>Don Pedro de Acunna</i> had
sent it so compleat, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196"
name="pb196">196</a>]</span>it was not reasonable to lose Time.
<i>Gallinato</i> answer&rsquo;d, representing the Greatness of the
Enterprize, and that they had provided no Necessaries to begin the
Work, hinting at some Home Particulars, which were signify&rsquo;d to
him by the <i>Portuguese</i> Commanders. The Votes being taken, it was
finally resolv&rsquo;d to land, because all Things were in readiness;
perhaps they conceited that the Enemies Power was imaginary, and that
they would submit at the Sight of our Army. <i>Gallinato</i> was always
of the <span class="marginnote">Gallinato <i>against it</i>.</span>
contrary Opinion; because that Weakness he was an Eye-witness to, could
not deceive him; and therefore that nothing might be wanting on his
Part, tho&rsquo; he was under Command, but much respected, he writ a
Role of the Things necessary for the Design in Hand, setting down in it
even the Hand-Spikes for moving of the Artillery, which had not been
provided in all that Time. By which may be seen, said <i>Gallinato</i>,
how great a Defect there had been in the Rest. When the Council broke
up, <i>Furtado</i> told <i>Gallinato</i>, he had order&rsquo;d, that as
soon as they landed, 200 <i>Portugueses</i> should mount the Guard,
with one Company of <i>Spaniards</i>. <i>Gallinato</i> begg&rsquo;d he
would give him leave to lead the Van, saying, he would not go as Chief,
but only as a Soldier, as being proud of serving under him. This he
requested very earnestly; but <i>Furtado</i>, who knew how to value
such Requests, answer&rsquo;d, That if he went he must accept of his
<span class="marginnote"><i>He begs to lead the Van and obtains
it.</i></span> Company. <i>Gallinato</i> reply&rsquo;d, That he should
take the Post due to his Person, since it was of such Consequence, and
do him the Favour to grant him the Van. He would not grant it at that
Time, but the next Day, he and his Admiral spoke to him, saying, He
assign&rsquo;d him the Van, by the Advice of his Admiral, and therefore
desired he would be content it might consist of the Number of Men he
had appointed. <i>Gallinato</i> accepted the Command, and valu&rsquo;d
it as was due. They landed on the 3d of <i>March</i>, and as they were
drawing up, <i>Furtado</i> would needs place two of his Colours, and
one of the <i>Spanish</i> in the Van, with 300 Men; the other three in
the Rear; and the Royal Standard, and himself to be in the main Body;
<i>Gallinato</i> was of Opinion, that all the Colours should march with
the main Body, but the General follow&rsquo;d his own Way.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>They move towards the Enemy.</i></span>
In this Order they began to move towards the Enemy, Captain <i>Don
Thomas</i> marching by <i>Gallinato</i>, who afterwards, in a Letter to
<i>Don Pedro</i>, said, <i>He this Day, and upon other Occasions, gave
good Proof, that he was the Son of such a Father, and these grey Hairs
of mine were sufficiently honour&rsquo;d with the Assistance of such a
Hand, and I was well defended and secure.</i> The Enemy being above
700, kept in a strong and safe Post, the Shore on which our Men
march&rsquo;d, being little or nothing, by Reason it was High-Water,
and that on the Land Side there was a very high Bank, and above it a
rising and close <i>Zacatal</i>, which could not be broke through.
<i>Zacatal</i> is a Field overgrown with such deep Grass or Weeds, that
many Men, and much Cattle may be hid among them. These are much thicker
<span class="marginnote">Zacatal <i>what it is</i>.</span> than the
Fields of Sedge, or Sheer-Grass in <i>Spain</i>. They call it
<i>Zacatal</i>, from the Word <i>Zacate</i>, signifying that Sort of
Grass or Weed, which grows up almost as thick as a Reed. Along this
narrow Slip of Shore, which was full of Rocks, and uneven, only three
Men could march abreast, he that was next the Sea, being partly in the
Water. The Enemy was possess&rsquo;d of this close Pass, and a great
Tree cut down for that Purpose, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197"
href="#pb197" name="pb197">197</a>]</span>and lying across the Place,
serv&rsquo;d them instead of a Trench. Behind <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Posture of the</i> Ternates.</span> it, and upon the
Bank, between it, and the <i>Zacatal</i>, appear&rsquo;d all their Men,
with Muskets, Fire-Locks, <i>Campilanes</i>, or Cymiters,
<i>Bacacacs</i>, or burnt Staves, Darts, Hand Granadoes, and Stones
which did not do us the least Harm. They had also five Drakes in this
Post, wherewith, upon some short Attacks, they kill&rsquo;d five
<i>Spaniards</i>; and afterwards, as the Action grew hotter, wounded
ten <i>Portugueses</i>, in such Sort that they dy&rsquo;d in a few
Days. <i>Gallinato</i> owns he was this Day in Danger of losing his
Honour; because the Colours, and all the Rest was in the utmost
Peril.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Gallinato <i>repulsed</i>.</span> The Enemy
fought in Safety, and did our Men so much Harm, that the first Charge
<i>Gallinato</i> gave, the <i>Ternates</i> fell on so furiously, as to
drive us from the Ground we had gain&rsquo;d. <i>Gallinato</i>
look&rsquo;d behind him to see the Colours he had brought with him in
the Van, with the 300 Men, and found them at his Back very thinly
Guarded. Thus the second Time the Shout was given to fall on, and he
again oblig&rsquo;d to retire, because he had fewer Men every time, and
the last they were scarce twenty. At length shaming those that
lagg&rsquo;d, and as it were inspiring new Vigour into them, he
<span class="marginnote"><i>Gains the Pass.</i></span> fell on so
fiercely, that he gain&rsquo;d the Post, and the five Drakes. The
<i>Ternates</i> lost all, or most of their best Men. <i>Gallinato</i>
follow&rsquo;d the Chace till he discover&rsquo;d the Fort, then he
halted, and order&rsquo;d our Camp to be Intrenched. The work was
begun, and the Enemy obstructed it twice, sending out Parties to
prevent planting the Gabions, and divert the Workmen; but they
retir&rsquo;d both times with loss. When the Trench was finished,
<i>Gallinato</i> <span class="marginnote">Spaniards
<i>Intrench</i>.</span> sent to the General to come to it. He came and
took up his Quarters, with all his Men, bringing the Royal Standard,
and all the Colours.</p>
<p>The next Day he judg&rsquo;d it convenient to carry the Lodgment
forward. <span class="marginnote"><i>Trenches carry&rsquo;d on nearer
to the Fort.</i></span> <i>Gallinato</i> undertook it, and with his Men
finish&rsquo;d the Trench, within 200 Paces of the Enemies Fort. There
they continu&rsquo;d some Days; and it being <i>Gallinato</i>&rsquo;s
Part only to obey, he sometimes gave his Opinion, and always did what
he was commanded. He did so, when the General told them it would be
convenient to carry on a Trench farther, to plant the Cannon. On the
Ninth of the same Month, before the Fort had been well view&rsquo;d, he
went to open the Trench, with his own Men, and 100 <i>Portugueses</i>,
a little above 100 Paces from the Walls, which being so near they all
soon perceiv&rsquo;d the danger of the Undertaking. It was the worse
for the Confusion and Noise in filling the Gabions. The next Day the
Cannon was brought thither, being four Guns, two thirteen, and two
sixteen Pounders. These sixteen Pounders, which the <i>Portuguese</i>
Soldiers call Camels, are short Pieces, unfit for Battery; besides that
the Bullets <span class="marginnote"><i>Stone Bullets unfit for
Battery.</i></span> were made of Stone, and broke as soon as they
touch&rsquo;d the Wall; being only fit to fire at the Houses.
<i>Gallinato</i> seeing this, told the General that since before they
landed he said, he had Cannon, he should order it to be brought on, and
planted in Battery, now he saw how ineffectual that they had
prov&rsquo;d. He answer&rsquo;d, that there was all he had, having left
the best in some Places he recover&rsquo;d the foregoing Year; and
could not bring any more such, by Reason of the stormy Weather.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Enemies Strength.</i></span> This
being mounted, the Battery began; but being so improper for this
Purpose, it was canonading the Air; for the Enemy overlook&rsquo;d, and
was strengthen&rsquo;d by a Stone <i>Cavalier</i>, which is that of Our
Lady, next the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name=
"pb198">198</a>]</span>Sea. Under it was a Ravelin, with seven heavy
Pieces of Cannon which did, and threatned greater Harm to our Camp. The
<i>Cavalier</i> was all Rampard, four Fathom high, and a Fathom and a
half broad; all which had been perform&rsquo;d, and rais&rsquo;d with
Espauls, by the Contrivance of the <i>Dutch</i>, who forwarded it, ever
since they traded with that Tyrant. On the Land Side ran the Curtin of
the Wall, as far as the Stone Bullwark, call&rsquo;d <i>Cachil
Tulo</i>, fortify&rsquo;d outwards with Massy Timbers, on which there
were three large Guns, and two on the Wall from this Bullwark to that
of our Lady. All these Works look&rsquo;d towards that Part, where our
Men had taken up their Quarters. These Forts had also a great Number of
Falconets, and Drakes; and the <i>Cavalier</i> that was batter&rsquo;d
being the strongest Part, where there was more Noise than Effect, the
General order&rsquo;d the Battery to cease.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>They Sally.</i></span> On Sunday the
sixteenth, between four and five in the Evening, the Enemy
sally&rsquo;d out of their Fort, with most of their Men to attack, and
gain the Trench, where our Cannon was planted. They assaulted it in
three Places, dividing their Men, next the Mountain in Front, and
towards the Shore. From the Mountainward came above 800
<i>Ternates</i>, with <i>Campilanes</i>, or Cymiters, in the Van of
them almost as many <i>Javaneses</i>, with Pikes 25 Spans long, all in
close Order. The Leader of them was a <span class="marginnote">Amuxa,
<i>the King&rsquo;s Nephew leads them</i>.</span> gallant Youth,
call&rsquo;d <i>Cachil Amuxa</i>, the King&rsquo;s Cousin German, and
Son to <i>Cachil Tulo</i>. Four hundred attack&rsquo;d in Front, and
many more next the Sea, each Body under its own Commander; who all fell
on together with such Vigour, that had not they who defended it been in
great Readiness, the Enemy could not miss of being Master of it. The
Captains <i>Pinto</i> and <i>Villagra</i> commanded in it, who defended
it bravely, but <i>Emanuel Andres</i>, Sergeant to <i>Villagra</i>,
<i>Alonso Roldan</i>, a Corporal, and another <i>Portuguese</i>, who
behav&rsquo;d himself gallantly, dy&rsquo;d fighting, being all run
through with Pikes. The Advantage soon appear&rsquo;d on the
<i>Spanish</i> Side, <span class="marginnote"><i>He is
Defeated.</i></span> which the Enemy perceiving, they turn&rsquo;d
their Backs, leaving the Commanders their King had the greatest Value
for, dead in the Field, and retired to the Fort. This Success gave
Occasion to draw another Trench nearer the Fort, to batter the Ravelin,
whence they did us Harm, with seven Pieces, notwithstanding our Work,
which was carry&rsquo;d on by the Captains <i>Villagra</i> and
<i>Sebastian Suarez</i>. On <i>Thursday</i> the Trench was almost
finish&rsquo;d, and being near, made them so uneasy, that the Besieged
began to batter it, with all their Cannon, but ineffectually, because
the <i>Gabions</i>, and Rampart on the Inside, could bear much more.
However, by this they perceiv&rsquo;d the Power and Strength of the
Enemy, and the Difficulty of the Undertaking.</p>
<p>On the twenty first of <i>March</i> the General came to the Trench,
and <span class="marginnote"><i>Council of War held.</i></span> calling
together the Captains, <i>Gallinato</i>, <i>Villagra</i>, <i>Antony
Andrea</i>, <i>John Fernandez de Torres</i>, <i>Gonzalo de
Sequeyra</i>, <i>Sebastian Suarez de Albergueria</i>, <i>Stephen
Texeira</i>, <i>Gaspar Pacheco</i>, the Admiral <i>Thomas de Sousa
Ronches</i>, <i>Lewis de Melo Sampayo</i>, <i>Jacome de Morales</i>,
<i>Don Lope de Almeyda</i>, <i>Ruy Gonzalez</i>, <i>Trajan Rodriguez
Castelbranco</i>, <i>Antony de Brito Fogaza</i>, <i>John Pinto de
Moraes</i>, and <i>Don Thomas Bravo</i>, and taking out a Missal, in
the first Place desir&rsquo;d them to take an Oath upon the holy
Evangelists, that they would not speak of, nor any otherwise reveal,
what he should <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name=
"pb199">199</a>]</span>there propose to them, and what should be
resolv&rsquo;d upon it, till effected. They all swore, and then he
propos&rsquo;d the Matter thus.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Furtado&rsquo;s <i>Speech to the
Council</i>.</span> <i>I have call&rsquo;d you together, Gentlemen, to
acquaint you with the Condition I am in at Present, and this Siege has
brought me to. It is two Years since I came from</i> Goa, <i>and during
my Voyage, have spent a great Quantity of Ammunition, upon several
Occasions; so that when we landed the other Day we had only ten Pipes
of Powder, and 29 Barrels sent me from</i> Manila. <i>Since I landed,
so much has been consum&rsquo;d, as is visible, in Skirmishes, and
Battery, that I have now much less than half that Quantity. The Dead,
Wounded and Sick, of our Foot, now wanting in the Camp, are 130; and
the rest, as daily Experience shows, fall Sick very fast of the
Distemper call&rsquo;d</i> Berber. <i>Our Provisions, tho&rsquo; we
took the Rice the Frigates brought from</i> Manila, <i>are so short,
that they can not last beyond the beginning of</i> June. <i>The Ships
and other Vessels of the Fleet, in the Opinion of the Pilots, run a
great Hazard, where they now lie at Anchor; because, when this Moon is
out, there can be no Safety for it, by reason of the high Winds and
Storms, unless they remove to another Place, and there is no other
but</i> Tydore. <i>We see how resolute, and well fortify&rsquo;d the
Enemy is, since all our Battery has produc&rsquo;d so little Effect,
and if they receive any Damage, it is soon made up by the Multitude of
People. The Friendship the King of</i> Tydore <i>promis&rsquo;d for
advancing of his Majesty&rsquo;s Service, has prov&rsquo;d so false,
that he has perform&rsquo;d nothing of what was concerted with him,
tho&rsquo; so reasonable, and beneficial to himself; having only been
free in Words, but his Actions have not yet been seen. I have had
sufficient Tryal of him. He has no other Design, but to deceive, and
amuse us, that our Men may be destroy&rsquo;d by Degrees, and so Time
may consume us if the Enemy cannot. When I press&rsquo;d him to do
something, to show at this Time that he was a Friend, and his
Majesty&rsquo;s Subject, he answer&rsquo;d, he would; but that we must
furnish Provisions for all his Men, because he had none. They demand
Powder and Ball, for every trivial Undertaking, that so they may
consume the little we have left; and when there is any Work to be done,
there are no Men for it. Of the few</i> Amboyneses <i>I brought with
me, for this Purpose, their Labour being great, some are return&rsquo;d
home, others gone to the Enemy. Those that remain are not sufficient,
and most of what has been hitherto done is owing to the Infantry; which
is so harrass&rsquo;d, that it can do no Service. The Enemy expects</i>
Dutch <i>Ships, and knows they are now at</i> Banda. <i>I have
Intelligence that they have sent for them, and if they come they will
be a great Obstacle to our Designs. Considering what I have
discours&rsquo;d of, I desire you, Gentlemen, and every one of you,
still under the Obligation of the Oath, to give me your Opinions, that
according to them I may resolve what to do, in pursuance of the great
Duty incumbent on me.</i></p>
<p>Upon the Request of the Captains, the General <i>Furtado</i> gave in
these Proposals in writing, tho&rsquo; he oppos&rsquo;d it at first. In
short they were written, as were the Opinions of the Councellors, among
whom the greater Part, even of the <i>Portugueses</i> oppos&rsquo;d the
General; and tho&rsquo; I ought to give some Account of their Votes,
because they had all different Views, yet, in Regard that most of them
assented to <i>Gallinato</i>&rsquo;s Opinion, it will suffice to set
down his Answer.</p>
<p>John Xuarez Gallinato, <i>Commander of the Provinces of the</i>
Pintados, <i>and</i> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200"
name="pb200">200</a>]</span><span class=
"marginnote"><i>Gallinato</i>&rsquo;s Answer to
<i>Furtado</i>.</span></p>
<p><i>the Officers attending me, do answer to the Proposal made by your
Lordship, as follows. That as to the want of Powder you represent, we
look upon it as essential, since we can not fight without it, and if
that fails, our Cannon and small Fire-Arms, are rather Encumbrances,
than Weapons, and therefore it is requisite to resolve and agree, where
and when to employ, and how much of what we have may be spent, so as
our Enterprize may succeed, since we see how ineffectual that hitherto
spent has been; considering, at the same Time, that a great Quantity is
to be reserv&rsquo;d, to fight five</i> Dutch <i>Galeons we expect;
which, if they come, part of our Fleet must of necessity go out and
ingage. For, if this be not done they will put Succours into the Place,
which tho&rsquo; never so inconsiderable, as but of 100 Muskets, would
be very prejudicial to us; besides that, it will be a great
Disreputation, not to meet them out at Sea.</i></p>
<p><i>As to the Mens sickning, being kill&rsquo;d and wounded, we say,
those are Misfortunes always attending War; and that we are sensible
how fast the Army grows weak, for which Reason, it will be necessary to
be the more expeditious in the Work we have in Hand; yet so that
neither too much Precipitation may expose it to Hazards, nor Delay give
Time for all the Army to fall Sick. As for the Scarcity of Provisions,
our Opinion is, that an Account be taken of what we have, how much is
consum&rsquo;d in a Month, and thus the necessary Distribution may be
made in Time; for otherwise we shall fall short, when we least expect
it; and Hunger will do us more Harm than the Enemy.</i></p>
<p><i>To the Danger of the Ships threatned by the Pilots, and their
Advice to go over to</i> Tydore<i>, we answer. That if the Fleet quits
the Station where it is, it will be a manifest Detriment to the Army,
which is supply&rsquo;d from it with all it Wants, and must want every
Thing upon its Absence. Besides, that if the Enemy see it once gone,
they will take fresh Courage; and if the</i> Dutch <i>come and find the
Harbour empty, it is plain they will possess themselves of it. Again,
if the Fleet makes off, must not a considerable Number of the Soldiers
go for its Security? Now how can it be proper to divide our Forces;
especially considering they are so small, and the Men so sickly?
Besides that here is no Place to lay up the Provisions, for the Waters
destroy them by Day and Night. Whilst aboard the Fleet, the Soldiers
have it daily brought fresh and wholesome. Farther, the Pilots, and
Natives of</i> Tydore<i>, say the Ships are safe in the Harbour till
after the Middle of</i> April.</p>
<p><i>We have had Tryal of the Enemies Power, and believe they have
Men, Ammunition, and Cannon to spare, considering our Condition; and
the Commanders, and Deserters from them confirm it. But neither can it
be deny&rsquo;d, that the very first Day we ingag&rsquo;d as we have
been told by Prisoners, and wounded Men, 1000 of the best Men they had
in</i> Ternate <i>came out to stop our Passage with five Pieces of
Cannon, and so posted, that only two of our Men could come up a Breast
to charge them; and yet they with all these Odds, were beaten off with
the Loss of many Men, as appear&rsquo;d by the dead Bodies,
scatter&rsquo;d along the Shore, where they also lost their Artillery.
The same Day we saw them sally upon the Fort of</i> Santiago<i>, where
Captain</i> Villagra <i>commanded, and tho&rsquo; our Men were
surpriz&rsquo;d, yet they repuls&rsquo;d them and slew the Flower of
their Commanders; so that they were certainly <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name="pb201">201</a>]</span>much
weakned; and streightned by Hunger and Sickness. And tho&rsquo; with
the Help of the</i> Dutch<i>, and their own Hardiness they repair the
Breaches, and fortify themselves with Artillery, Means may be found to
surmount these Difficulties, for if there were none, it would be no War
we are ingag&rsquo;d in.</i></p>
<p><i>We are sensible of the King of</i> Tydore<i>&rsquo;s Want of
Faith; but what discreet Commander has not made the best of such
Accidents, and wink&rsquo;d at disloyal, and unsteady Persons till a
more favourable Opportunity; Besides, before we landed, Notice was
taken of this Princes Indifferency, and that his Design is to protract
the War, rather in Hatred to</i> Ternate<i>, than out of any Love to
our Nation. We our selves will make amends for the Want of Labourers;
we will be both Soldiers and Pioniers, as we have hitherto been; for
the Sword and the Spade are equally honourable in so just a War; and we
again offer our selves, and our Soldiers, to perform whatsoever shall
be for the Service of God and the King.</i></p>
<p><i>It is therefore our Opinion, that the Galeons remove immediately;
that two of them Anchor between our Ladies</i> Cavalier<i>, and</i> S.
Paul<i>, and batter the inside of the</i> Cavalier<i>, and the other
two, the House of</i> S. Paul<i>, the Fort, and the Town. Then of
Necessity the Defendants within must fly, since the Defence of the
Stone Parapet, is but a meer Show, except only where it looks upon the
open Country. As soon as the Galeons begin to batter, we will also
batter the Ravelin before the</i> Cavalier, <i>where the seven Pieces
of Cannon are, which will certainly be ruin&rsquo;d in two Hours,
because our Fort of</i> S. Christopher <i>commands them, and the
Thickness is not above a Fathom. To conclude, My Lord, the Want of
Provisions, and of Health, the coming of the</i> Dutch, <i>the
Resolution of the Besieged, of all other Difficulties will be
surmounted by Celerity. We are ready to perform all Things on our Part;
it belongs to your Lordship to make Tryal of our Promise. It will not
be reasonable immediately to abandon the small Remains of Christianity
in the</i> Moluccos<i>, and the Hopes of regaining what has been lost,
in vain endeavour&rsquo;d for so many Years, at the Expence of so many
Millions of Money, so many Lives, and the Honour of</i> European
<i>Nations, by turning our Backs upon so holy an Undertaking.</i></p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Furtado <i>dissolves the Council, and acts
counter to it.</i></span> This Answer was sent in a Paper signed by the
Captains, to satisfy all his Doubts, for they answer&rsquo;d others by
Word of Mouth, which were started by the <i>Portuguese</i> Commanders
to perswade drawing off; but the General Thanking both Parties for
their Zeal in Advising, broke up the Council; and on <i>Saturday</i>
the 22d, came to a Resolution, which he left to be put in Execution the
next Day. That Night he drew off the Cannon; and on <i>Sunday</i>
Night, at the second Watch, the Forces began to March towards the
Shore, where the Ships lay to take in the Men. The Admiral, <i>Thomas
de Sousa</i>, led the Van; the General and his Officers, the Main Body;
and <i>John Xuarez Gallinato</i>, with the Captains <i>Don Thomas
Bravo</i>, <i>John Fernandez de Torres</i>, and <i>Christopher
Villagra</i>, and the Musketiers, brought up the Rear. <span class=
"marginnote"><i>The Forces Shipp&rsquo;d off.</i></span> In this Order
the Foot were Shipp&rsquo;d off, and got all aboard by the Morning. At
the same time two <i>Dutch</i> Men, of those that were in the Fort with
the Enemy, fled from it, and came to the Ships. Among other
Intelligence, they told the <i>Spaniards</i> how strong the Enemy were
in Men and Cannon: That they had 36 heavy Pieces <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name=
"pb202">202</a>]</span>mounted on the Ravelin near our Ladies; seven on
<i>Cachil Tulo</i>&rsquo;s Bastion; three between them; and two on the
<i>Cavalier</i>; three at S. <i>Paul</i>&rsquo;s; eight in the Main
Fort; three at <i>Limatao</i>; three more on that Bastion, and four
more near it.</p>
<p>This Day <i>Furtado</i> propos&rsquo;d to sail away with the Fleet
towards <i>Amboyna</i>, but wanting Water, put it off for four Days,
and during that time <i>Gallinato</i> had leasure to Discourse him,
since he was going away, about providing <span class=
"marginnote">Furtado <i>refuses to supply</i> Tydore, <i>and other
Places</i>.</span> the Fort of <i>Tydore</i>, which could not be
Maintain&rsquo;d without Supplies. He Answer&rsquo;d, He was very
willing to do it, but could not; and therefore would send Succours from
<i>Amboyna</i>. Application was made to him to provide for other Wants,
which concern&rsquo;d his Majesties Service, to which he return&rsquo;d
the same Answer. He press&rsquo;d him to consider, in what Condition he
left the Fort of <i>Machian</i>, whereto particular Regard ought to be
had, because there were 50 Men and a Captain, with the small Vessel,
call&rsquo;d a <i>Galizabra</i>, and he must either Relieve, or
Dismantle it. He said, He had already sent to Destroy it, and did
believe it was then Raz&rsquo;d. <span class="marginnote">Machian
<i>Fort raz&rsquo;d</i>.</span></p>
<p>Having taken this Order, and Leave of the Commanders, he set sail on
<i>Thursday</i> the 27th of <i>March</i>, sending a Letter to <i>Don
Pedro de Acunna</i>, the Governour of the <i>Philippine</i> Islands,
with an Account of the Particulars of this Enterprize: A small Part of
it will suffice to express the Thoughts and Intention of so Discreet a
Commander as he has been prov&rsquo;d by his former and later Actions;
for it is not to be believ&rsquo;d that he would quit the Attempt upon
<i>Ternate</i>, without substantial Reasons: <i>The Succours your
Lordship <span class="marginnote"><i>Part of</i> Furtado<i>&rsquo;s
Letter to the Governor of the</i> Philippines.</span> sent me, says he,
by Gods Assistance, came in good Time; for it was Providence that
furnished his Majesty with this Fleet, and sav&rsquo;d the Lives of us,
who still enjoy them. By what has happen&rsquo;d in this Expedition,
his Majesty will understand how much he is beholding to your Lordship,
and how little to the Commander of</i> Malaca<i>; since it is his
Fault, that his Majesty was not serv&rsquo;d. When the Succours your
Lordship sent me arriv&rsquo;d, this Fleet had no Ammunition, as having
been two Years out from</i> Goa<i>, and having spent it as Occasion
offer&rsquo;d. Wherefore, that it might not be thought I Obstructed his
Majesties Service, I landed; and did it with the Loss of many of the
Enemies. I carry&rsquo;d up my last Trenches within 100 Paces of the
Enemies Works, planted five heavy Battering-Pieces; and in ten Days
Battery a great part of a Bastion, wherein the Enemies main Strength
consisted, was ruin&rsquo;d. During that Time all the Powder the Fleet
had was spent, without leaving enough for one Charge of the Guns, and
if it should happen, as I do not question it will, that I meet any
Squadron of</i> Dutch<i>, I must of Necessity fight them, this being my
principal Motive for raising of the Siege, when the Enemy was
reduc&rsquo;d to great Streights, both by Want, and for that many of
their best Commanders had been kill&rsquo;d during the Siege. By this
your Lordship may guess at the Condition I am in.</i> This Letter
dilates upon the Complaints against the Governours of <i>India</i>. He
promises <i>Don Pedro</i>, that if he meets with any Succours at
<i>Amboyna</i>, and is not oblig&rsquo;d to go relieve the southern
Parts, he will return to the <i>Moluccos</i>, tho&rsquo; he be
forc&rsquo;d to go refit as far as <i>Malaca</i>. He praises and
recommends the Captains <i>Gallinato</i>, <i>Don Thomas</i>,
<i>Villagra</i>, and their fellow Soldiers, and so concludes the
Letter.</p>
<p><i>Gallinato</i> went to <i>Tydore</i>, where he was inform&rsquo;d,
that tho&rsquo; the Fort of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href=
"#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span><i>Machian</i> was
abandon&rsquo;d, only one Bastian of it was dismantled; so that if the
Enemy would possess themselves of it, they might do it with Ease, and
were actually about it. Hereupon he spoke to the King of <i>Tydore</i>,
<span class="marginnote">Gallinato <i>at</i> Tydore <i>takes Care
of</i> Machian.</span> and the <i>Portuguese</i> Commander in Chief,
recommending to them, that they would either take Care to maintain, or
else quite raze that Fort. They commission&rsquo;d a Captain to do the
latter, who going to perform it, loaded the Vessel, call&rsquo;d
<i>Galizabra</i> with 200 Quintals, or a hundred Weight of Clove, and
return&rsquo;d to <i>Tydore</i>, to the great Satisfaction of the
<i>Portugueses</i> of that Island. At this Time the King of
<i>Ternate</i> was repairing the Breaches in his Fortifications, and
rais&rsquo;d new Defences, providing against Dangers he knew Nothing of
yet. His Subjects are Warlike, <span class="marginnote"><i>Falshood of
the King of</i> Tydore.</span> with whom, and the Assistance of the
<i>Dutch</i>, he thought his Kingdome invincible. Great Matters might
have been expected could any Confidence be repos&rsquo;d in the King of
<i>Tydore</i>; but our Commanders say his People, and those of
<i>Ternate</i> understand one another.</p>
<p>On the 17th of <i>April</i>, the King of <i>Tydore</i> acquainted
<i>Gallinato</i>, that with <span class="marginnote"><i>The King and
Queen of</i> Tydore <i>at Variance</i>.</span> his Leave he
design&rsquo;d to make Peace with the King of <i>Ternate</i>. He
answer&rsquo;d, He would do well to consider what was expedient for his
own Dominions, without Detriment to his Majesty&rsquo;s Service. The
same Day the <i>Sangiack</i> of <i>Nua</i>, in the Kingdom of
<i>Bachian</i>, came to <i>Tydore</i>. He was a Christian, and laying
hold of the Opportunity of serving his Majesty in the last Expedition,
visited the Queen of <i>Tydore</i>, a beautiful young Lady, Daughter to
the King of <i>Bachian</i>, who liv&rsquo;d discontented, because the
King her Husband was more fond of another ancient Woman, and not so
well born. The <i>Sangiack</i> had Commission and Strength to steal her
away, and conduct her to her Father, since neither Complaints,
<span class="marginnote"><i>She is stolen away<span class="corr" id=
"xd21e23817" title="Not in source">.</span></i></span> Intreaties, nor
any other Methods had been of Force to reclaim the King. On the 4th of
<i>May</i>, came a Sister of the King&rsquo;s, on the same Pretence of
visiting her <span class="corr" id="xd21e23823" title=
"Source: Neice">Niece</span>, and reconciling her to the King. The
<i>Sangiack</i> and she having concerted those Affairs, the young Queen
going abroad with them to an Entertainment, and all Things being
provided, they embark&rsquo;d, and sail&rsquo;d away towards
<i>Bachian</i>. The King of <i>Tydore</i> was enrag&rsquo;d, out of
Patience, and apprehensive of a new War; tho&rsquo; afterwards this
Difference was amicably adjusted, by the Interposition of <i>Cachil
Malua</i>, a principal Person of <i>Bachian</i>.</p>
<p>On the 22d of <i>May</i> News was brought to <i>Tydore</i>, that the
King of <i>Ternate</i>, had fitted out 50 Carcoas in his Harbour, and
expected the <i>Dutch</i> Ships. He, at the same Time, made Rejoycings,
in a triumphant Manner for the Departure of the <i>Spaniards</i>. It
was requisite to leave some Men and Provisions in the Fort of
<i>Tydore</i>, which being done, <i>Gallinato</i>, who <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Fort of</i> Tydore <i>supply&rsquo;d</i>.</span> had
before writ by an Advice-Boat, to the General and Governour of the
<i>Philippine</i> Islands, left the <i>Moluccos</i>, and sail&rsquo;d
himself that Way. This was the Event of that so long intended and
threatned Undertaking, which I have deliver&rsquo;d impartially, having
search&rsquo;d after, and even guess&rsquo;d at some Excuses to justify
the Behaviour of so great a Commander as <i>Andrew Furtado</i>;
enquiring of those very Officers who were present at the Attacks, and
in the Councils. Neither by them, nor by the General&rsquo;s own
Memorials <span class="marginnote"><i>Impartiality of the
Author.</i></span> and Papers, can be found or made out any more than
what appears by those which have been here inserted; but to judge of
these Affairs is not the Part of an Historian. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name="pb204">204</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Earl of</i> Lemos <i>President of the
Council of the</i> Indies<span class="corr" id="xd21e23897" title=
"Not in source">.</span></span> This same Year, about the beginning of
<i>April</i>, the Presidentship of the Council of the <i>Indies</i> was
conferr&rsquo;d on <i>Don Pedro Fernandez de Castro</i>, Earl of
<i>Lemos</i> and <i>Andrade</i>, Marquess <i>de Sarria</i>, Chief of
his Family, whose Royal Antiquity is well known, Nephew and Son-in-law
to the Duke of <i>Lerma</i>. In his Youth he gave such Hopes, as were
afterwards fulfill&rsquo;d by his Actions. He was then Gentleman of the
<span class="corr" id="xd21e23922" title=
"Source: Bed-Camber">Bed-Chamber</span> to our King. The World made the
same Judgment of him, that the Senate of <i>Rome</i> had in his Time of
<i>Scipio</i>, afterwards call&rsquo;d <i>Africanus</i>, when it made a
Scruple of entrusting him with Matters of great Difficulty, because he
was so young. But Experience soon made appear in the Earl, as well as
in <i>Scipio</i>, that Prudence, which regulates all other Virtues,
often anticipates grey Hairs. It is no Merit of the Off-spring to be
descended from Noble, or <i>Plebeyan</i> Families; but such was the
Vivacity of this great Man&rsquo;s Spirit, and Judgment, that had he
been born Mean, he might by his own natural <span class=
"marginnote"><i>This was writ when he was living.</i></span> Parts have
made his Fortune. No Man can say he wanted publick or private
Accomplishment. In him appears a settled Magnanimity; with a courteous
Sincerity; yet temper&rsquo;d with that Justice we extol in the severe
Austereness of some of the Ancients. These Virtues are interwoven with
Religion, a Zeal for its Propagation, and the universal Agreement,
which is the Product of publick Tranquility. Thus he serv&rsquo;d his
King, with Care and Solicitude; without Intermission, or seeking
himself and his Advantage. It will be requisite to be brief in this
Particular, because his singular Modesty is not pleas&rsquo;d with the
Soothings of Commendation; but is as averse to Flattery, as remote from
standing in need of it.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Member of the said Council, at that
Time.</i></span> The Earl found the Council fill&rsquo;d with zealous
and grave Men; the Lords <i>Benedict Rodriguez Valtodano</i>, <i>Peter
Bravo de Sotomayor</i>, <i>Alonso Molina de Medrano</i>, Knight of the
Order of <i>Santiago</i>, or S. <i>James</i> the Apostle, <i>James de
Armenteros</i>, <i>Gonzalo de Aponte</i>, <i>Don Thomas Ximenes
Ortis</i>, <i>Don Francisco Arias Maldonado</i>, <i>Benavente de
Benavides</i>, <i>John de Villagutierre</i>, <i>Lewis de Salcedo</i>,
and <i>Ferdinand de Villagomez</i>; all of them qualify&rsquo;d by
Extraction, noted for Learning, and having taken the highest Degrees in
it. These were Counsellors, and the last of them Solicitor General of
that Assembly. To which also belong&rsquo;d <i>John de Ybarra</i>,
Knight of the Order of <i>Calatrava</i>, and Commendary of
<i>Moratalaz</i>, and <i>Peter de Lodesma</i>, the King&rsquo;s
Secretaries. In the Places of the Licenciates, <i>Molina de
Medrano</i>, and <i>Gonzalo de Aponte</i>, whom his Majesty afterwards
employ&rsquo;d in his Royal Council of <i>Castile</i>, and in those of
some who dy&rsquo;d, his Majesty, at several Times put in the
Licenciates, <i>Lewis de Salcedo</i>, <i>Gudiel</i>, and <i>Don Francis
de Texada y de Mendoza</i>, Doctor <i>Bernard de Olmedilla</i>, and
<i>John de Ybarra</i>, &amp;c. All these amidst that Multitude of
Business they dexterously dispatch&rsquo;d, laid all their main
Designs, for the restoring his Majesty&rsquo;s Monarchy to its Fulness,
in those utmost Limits of it; a Project suitable to the Genius of the
new President. He enquiring into the general and particular Posture of
all Things then depending, met with that of the <i>Molucco</i> Islands,
and finding it of Consequence, and almost forgotten, inclin&rsquo;d to
give it a helping Hand.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Br. <i>Gaspar Gomez</i> informs the
Council.</span> Much about this Time, Brother <i>Gaspar Gomez</i> came
into <i>Spain</i>, being sent by <i>Don Pedro de Acunna</i>, to
solicite that Enterprize. The Brother at several tedious Audiences,
gave the President full Information of all that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name=
"pb205">205</a>]</span>concern&rsquo;d the <i>Molucco</i> Islands,
their Wealth, the great Treasure <i>Spain</i> has expended in Attempts
to recover them, to restore persecuted Christianity, where it had been
so much receiv&rsquo;d; and what Consequence it was, that this should
be done by Way of the <i>Philippine</i> Islands. The Earl undertook
that Cause, as such ought to be supported, and consulted about it with
the Council, with the Duke of <i>Lerma</i>, and most particularly with
the King&rsquo;s Confessor. He never desisted, till it was brought to
bear, and in such a Forwardness, that it might be effectually
dispatch&rsquo;d. The Members of the supream Council, with the same
Zeal, and considering the repeated Disappointments of this Enterprize,
forwarded the Expedition, and all of them agreed that <i>Don Pedro de
Acunna</i> should undertake it in Person. This favourable Disposition
of theirs, was fully confirm&rsquo;d, by the News brought a Year after,
of the ill Success of the united Forces of <i>India</i> under
<i>Furtado</i>, and those of the <i>Philippine</i> Islands, under
<i>Gallinato</i>. It was writ by <i>Don Pedro de Acunna</i>, describing
it to the Life, with Duplicates for his Majesty, and the prime
Ministers, and though he left much to Brother <i>Gaspar Gomez</i>, he
was very particular himself.</p>
<p>He complain&rsquo;d that they had let slip such an Opportunity of
Recovering <i>Ternate</i>, and chastising the <i>Dutch</i>, who resort
thither to the Trade of <span class="marginnote"><i>Don</i> Pedro de
Acunna&rsquo;<i>s letter concerning the Enterprize on</i>
Ternate.</span> Clove, Mace, and other Spice, and Drugs. He represented
the Danger the <i>Philippine</i> Islands were in, after that
Neighbouring Tyrant&rsquo;s Victory; and that having more particularly
weigh&rsquo;d the Circumstances of that Affair, besides the Necessity
of regaining the Reputation lost there, he found that whatsoever has
been yet said, was short. For not to mention the principal End, which
was the Propagation of the Faith, but only with Regard to the
King&rsquo;s Revenue, he show&rsquo;d, That <i>Ternate</i> being
reduc&rsquo;d it would be easie to subdue the Islands of <i>Banda</i>,
which are above thirty, lying about a hundred Leagues from the
<i>Moluccos</i>, full of valuable Mace, and possess&rsquo;d by an
unwar-like People, would add that Income to <i>Spain</i>, and take it
from the <i>Dutch</i>, who carry all away, with little or no
Opposition. He promis&rsquo;d the same as to the Islands <i>Papuas</i>,
which are many, not far distant from <i>Ternate</i>, some of them
Subjects to that King, and yielding him a considerable Quantity of
Gold, Amber, and other valuable Tribute. Then he extended to the Great
<i>Batochina</i>, or <i>Gilolo</i>, describing its Fertility, and how
that Tyrannical King oppress&rsquo;d it. Those of <i>Celebes</i> 45
Leagues from <i>Ternate</i>, where he had strong Garrisons. The Greater
and Lesser <i>Javas</i>, whose Kings would again submit to
<i>Spain</i>, as soon as the <i>Moluccos</i> were brought under. He
earnestly recommended Secresie and Expedition. To evince the Necessity
of both, besides the usual Reasons, he urg&rsquo;d that as soon as
those Rebels and the <i>Dutch</i> hear of any War-like Preparations,
they spare neither Cost, nor Labour, to make all necessary Provision;
and that they never sail by the Coasts of <i>India</i> without ruining,
and plundering them. He affirm&rsquo;d, that the General <i>Furtado</i>
was no way to blame for having abandon&rsquo;d that Enterprize; for as
it plainly appear&rsquo;d, and Captain <i>Gallinato</i> declar&rsquo;d
he had always behav&rsquo;d himself like a brave Gentleman, and
discreet Commander; but that besides the Want of Provisions and
Ammunition, he could not relie upon his own Men; and that if the
Succours sent him from <i>Manila</i> had been more considerable, he
would have hazarded all with only them. He said, the King of
<i>Tydore</i> had sent him great <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206"
href="#pb206" name="pb206">206</a>]</span>Complaints against the
General <i>Furtado</i>, and that it was a common saying with him. That
before he came to the <i>Moluccos</i> the King of <i>Tydore</i> Slept,
and he of <i>Ternate</i> Watch&rsquo;d; but now the Case was
alter&rsquo;d, and the contrary might be said. Yet he believ&rsquo;d he
was not heartily sorry for the Disappointment. The same he urg&rsquo;d
in Relation to the Kings of <i>Bachian</i> and <i>Sian</i>. He
concluded, offering to undertake that Affair in Person, provided he
might be furnish&rsquo;d with what was necessary, that he might not be
Distress&rsquo;d as his Predecessors had been. Then he went on, by way
of Answer to the Objections, or Accusations of the <i>Spanish</i>
Commanders, who being us&rsquo;d to the Wars in <i>Europe</i>,
despis&rsquo;d all other Enemies, who made War without all those
Engines, and Fire-Arms us&rsquo;d in <i>Flanders</i>, <i>France</i>,
and <i>England</i>. He says, none of those Eastern Provinces wanted any
of the Inventions we have in <i>Europe</i>; and that besides the great
Numbers they have, and the Dexterity in using them of the
<i>Japoneses</i>, <i>Chineses</i>, <i>Mindanaos</i>, and
<i>Moluccos</i>, they are no less expert at their Bows, and Arrows;
especially the <i>Javaneses</i>, who conquer when they fly, and that
they are not destitute of such Strategems, that the <i>Spaniards</i>
have need of all their Valour against them, and their numerous Armies.
He owns the <i>Molucco</i> Islands can not stand in Competition, with
the strong and populous Cities taken in our Parts, but that
nevertheless, so many Christian Churches as have been polluted in them;
the banishing of our Religion; the Persecution of its Ministers; the
continual Tyrannical Practices; and Alliance of those People, with the
<i>Dutch</i>, his Majesties last Rebels, ought not to be cast into
Oblivion. And that, were there no other Motive but this, the King ought
to retrieve his Honour, which is concern&rsquo;d for the loss of so
many of his Fleets, and Commanders. It is very remarkable, that
tho&rsquo; in these Letters he gave an Account of the Posture of
Affairs, either as to Peace, or War, of so many several Kings, among
whose Territories the <i>Spanish</i> Arms appear, not without Glory;
yet he insists not so much on any Point, as that of <i>Ternate</i>,
which was grown Old by above thirty Years standing, to the Discredit of
our Nation. From all this may be inferr&rsquo;d, how necessary it is
always, in Affairs of great Difficulty, to bend the entire
Understanding to them, and to be in Love with the Design
conceiv&rsquo;d, that so the Event may answer the Expectation. He at
the same Time sent long Reflections, and Projects of the Count <i>de
Monterey</i>, then Viceroy of <i>Peru</i>, relating to the Execution of
that Affair, wherein it plainly appear&rsquo;d, by the Consonancy of
the Reasons, And the Opinions of Men well acquainted with those Parts,
that the Expedition was of greater Concern and Importance, than all the
Arguments made use of upon the like Occasions do ever amount to.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Lewdness of the King of</i> Ternate
<i>and</i> Cachil Amuxa.</span> Thus was <i>Ternate</i> bandy&rsquo;d
in the Councils of <i>Spain</i>, whilst at home it abounded in Trade,
yet stood upon its Guard, and particularly the King, whose Prosperity
gave him Occasion to indulge his Inclinations, of Cruelty towards the
Christians, and private Satisfaction to himself. He gave himself up to
the Love of <i>Celicaya</i>, yet being divided among so many Women, it
had not the usual Power over him, but allow&rsquo;d of other
Diversions. <i>Cachil Amuxa</i>, the bravest of his Commanders, and his
Cousin <i>German</i>, was newly Marry&rsquo;d to a Daughter of the King
of <i>Mindanao</i>, a singular Beauty, not of the <i>Asiatick</i> Sort,
but of the <i>Spanish</i> or <i>Italian</i>. The King, who was
us&rsquo;d to observe no Rules, courted her as a Gallant, and as a
King, persisting, and presenting her; and was soon admitted by the
<i>Indian</i> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name=

a while conceal&rsquo;d his Wrong; at length, by the King&rsquo;s
contriving to keep him abroad, and the Interposition of Time, which
reveals all Secrets, found out who it was defil&rsquo;d his Bed. What
could the unfortunate Man do? He durst not kill his Wife, for the Love
he bore her, and for Fear of the King&rsquo;s Displeasure. He
resolv&rsquo;d to be reveng&rsquo;d, as if it had been in a Money
Concern. In order to it, he dissembled the best he could, and
whensoever he had an Opportunity to talk to Queen <i>Celicaya</i>,
either feign&rsquo;d, or profess&rsquo;d Love, till he had inculcated
it as he desir&rsquo;d. He bore with the Disdain and Threats, which are
the Weapons Nature bestow&rsquo;d on that Sex; and Perseverance
prevail&rsquo;d, for <i>Celicaya</i> rewarded <i>Cachil</i>&rsquo;s
Love. This Intrigue continu&rsquo;d <span class="marginnote">Amuxa
<i>Cuckolds the King in Revenge</i>.</span> a considerable Time, till
the King found it out, and both Rivals took Notice of it. Tho&rsquo;
the King more deeply resented the Reprisal his Kinsman had made, to be
reveng&rsquo;d; yet they did not fall out on that Account, nor forbear
conversing together. They preserv&rsquo;d Peace and Friendship in their
Houses; and the King stood so much in need of <i>Cachil Amuxa</i>, for
his Wars, which in those Parts are no less frequent, than Peace, the
special Blessing of Heaven, is among us, that he durst not declare
against him, and what is more, not so much as displease
<i>Celicaya</i>. She, as if the Abuse tolerated in Men had been
allow&rsquo;d to Women, justify&rsquo;d herself by alledging the Wrong
the King had done her in courting the other. However, <span class=
"marginnote"><i>The King&rsquo;s Revenge.</i></span> the King being
once in the Field, under one of their Arbours, and <i>Cachil Amuxa</i>
coming in, without his <i>Campilan</i>, or Cymiter, the Guards upon a
Signal given them, handled their Arms, fell upon, and gave him many
Wounds on his Head, Face, Arms and Body, none daring to defend him. He
was sensible of the Occasion, and Revenge, and suddenly drawing a small
<i>Criz</i>, or Dagger, he happen&rsquo;d to have about him, did not
only defend himself against many Cuts and Thrusts, but assaulted the
Murderers, and with great Activity, wounded some, bore down others, and
put the rest to Flight, killing four. Nor had his Fury stopp&rsquo;d
there, but that the King slipp&rsquo;d away; tho&rsquo; now his Wounds
had weaken&rsquo;d <i>Amuxa</i> by Reason of the great Quantity of
Blood that ran from them. He was left for dead; but an Uncle of his,
hearing the Noise, came in to his Assistance, with his Followers; who
all bound up his Wounds, and carry&rsquo;d him to his House, where he
was cur&rsquo;d, by the King&rsquo;s Permission. This was the Effect of
his Fear, rather than good Nature, for all his Kindred took the Injury
upon themselves, and began to meditate Revenge; which they would
certainly have compass&rsquo;d, and made fair Way for the Pretension of
<i>Spain</i>, had not those who were apprehensive of another War soon
reconcil&rsquo;d those Animosities. The <i>Cachil</i> was cur&rsquo;d,
but with such Scars in his Face, and so many deep Gashes and Seams in
his Head, that he was nothing like the Man he had been before. So say
they who knew him, and have seen him in our Days at <i>Manila</i> and
<i>Ternate</i>. He was restor&rsquo;d to the King&rsquo;s Favour, and
both of them to that of their Wives, without Notice taken of the
Accident, or as if it had been a Secret. So great is the Difference in
the Humours of Nations.</p>

<p class="first"><span class="marginnote"><i>Preparations in</i> Spain
<i>against the</i> Moluccos.</span> The continual Application of the
President and Council to expedite the Enterprize, seem&rsquo;d to be a
Presage of the late ill Success at the <i>Molucco</i> Islands. The true
Account of it was brought in <i>Don Pedro de Acunna</i>&rsquo;s
Letters. The King and his Ministers were concern&rsquo;d at it; but at
the same Time, it was a Motive to hasten the Preparations, recover the
lost Reputation, and put an End at once to that Strife. Some attributed
the Miscarriage to Disagreement between <i>Gallinato</i> and
<i>Furtado</i>; others suspected the Discord had been between the
<i>Spanish</i> and <i>Portuguese</i> Nations. None urg&rsquo;d that it
might be for Want of Necessaries for carrying on the Work. These
Debates ended, and the President espousing the Business with the
Resolution that was requisite, represented the Matter in a lively
Manner to the King, recounting what the General <i>Furtado</i> had
done, the Succours sent by <i>Don Pedro de Acunna</i> under
<i>Gallinato</i>, and how, tho&rsquo; the Officers and Soldiers
<span class="marginnote"><i>The Presidents Remonstrance to the
King.</i></span> did their Duty, the Success fail&rsquo;d. That it was
look&rsquo;d upon as most certain, That the <i>Molucco</i> Kings, who
still continu&rsquo;d under Subjection, had acted coldly. That this
Failure in them was occasion&rsquo;d by a Sort of State Policy, easy to
be seen thro&rsquo;; which was the Protracting of the War, and making
use of our Arms for their private Advantage, without desiring it should
be fully concluded. That if Means were not us&rsquo;d for expelling the
<i>Dutch</i> out of <i>Ternate</i>, they would become absolute Masters
of the <i>Archipelago</i> of the <i>Conception</i>, and deprive his
Majesty of all the Revenue <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href=

done in the most considerable Parts of <i>India</i>.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The King&rsquo;s Answer.</i></span> The
King having consider&rsquo;d it, approv&rsquo;d of what was laid before
him; and being sensible of its mighty Importance, judg&rsquo;d the
Number of Ships, Men and Arms demanded, too small; and therefore added
more with his own Royal Hand, without fixing a certain Proportion; and
order&rsquo;d, that no Time should be lost, seeming very earnest to
have his Decree put in Execution. In the same Manner he directed,
thro&rsquo; the Intervention of the Duke of <i>Lerma</i>, that the
Design in Hand should be carry&rsquo;d on. Hereupon the Council
pass&rsquo;d the Necessary Orders, and the President sent Letters and
Instructions to the Viceroy of <i>New Spain</i>, and the Governour of
the <i>Philippine</i> Islands, that they might with the same Diligence
fulfil the Commands they should receive as to this Point. The King in
his Order sent to this Effect, declar&rsquo;d his Will, and the Method
he was pleas&rsquo;d should be observ&rsquo;d as follows.</p>

Philippine <span class="marginnote"><i>The King&rsquo;s Letter to</i>

in them. On the 20th of</i> September <i>of the last Year 1603, I writ
to you by an Advice Boat, which carry&rsquo;d</i> Gaspar Gomez, <i>of
the Society of</i> JESUS, <i>to</i> New Spain, <i>acquainting you with
the Resolution I had taken concerning what you writ to me from</i> New
Spain, <i>when you went to serve me those Posts, relating to the
Expedition of</i> Ternate. <i>Pursuant to it, I have order&rsquo;d 500
Men to be rais&rsquo;d in these Kingdoms, who shall be sent aboard the
Fleet that is to go this Year to</i> New Spain. <i>I writ to the
Viceroy, directing him to raise 500 more, that so you may have at least
800 sent you for this Enterprize. I have appointed four Captains to
carry them from this Kingdom; one of whom is the Vice-Admiral</i> John
de Esquivel, <i>to be Commander in Chief of the said Men; besides six
in half Pay, who are skillful and experienc&rsquo;d Soldiers, that in
Case any of the said Captains dye by the Way, they may supply their
Places; and that they may take Charge of the Companies to be
rais&rsquo;d in</i> New Spain, <i>as I write to the Viceroy. I have
appointed the said Captains 40</i> <span class="marginnote"><i>Captains
and their Pay.</i></span> <i>Ducats a Month Pay, and the
Vice-Admiral</i> John de Esquivel <i>60. Those in half Pay are to have
25 Ducats; and from that Time forward, the said</i> John de Esquivel,
<i>in Case I order him to have the Title of Collonel, shall have 120
Ducats a Month; and whilst he serves under the Title of Commander in
Chief of the said Men, to have 90 Ducats a Month; the Captain: 60, and
those in half Pay 40. The Soldiers, as well those rais&rsquo;d in</i>
Spain, <span class="marginnote"><i>Soldiers Pay.</i></span> <i>as those
from</i> New Spain, <i>shall have Eight Ducats a Month; the Viceroy
being order&rsquo;d to send to those Islands as much Money as is
requisite for a Years Pay, according to those Rates. And, if they shall
be longer detain&rsquo;d upon other Occasions of my Service, he shall
also furnish what is Necessary, upon Advice from you. Concerning which
I have thought fit to acquaint, charge and command you, that in Case
this Pay of the Soldiers can be moderated,</i> <span class=

you shall make no Alteration in the Pay of the Vice-Admiral</i> John de
Esquivel, <i>nor of the Captains, Ensigns, and those in half Pay. I
have also directed the Viceroy to furnish you with whatsoever shall be
requisite, as far as 120000 Ducats you have demanded <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name="pb210">210</a>]</span>for
this Expedition, six Pieces of Battering Cannon, and 500 Quintals, or
hundred Weight of Musket Powder. The Men from hence go arm&rsquo;d with
Muskets and Firelocks. You must be very careful that there be due
Order, Rule and Method in the Distribution of the said Money, and every
Thing besides. You shall endeavour to perform what is intended, as I
expect you</i> <span class="marginnote">Don Pedro <i>to go in</i>
Person.</span> <i>will, with the Men sent from hence and from</i> New
Spain<i>, and those you may have rais&rsquo;d in those Islands for the
Expedition against</i> Ternate. <i>If it be possible you shall go in
Person, as you have offer&rsquo;d to do, leaving those Islands in the
best Order that may be. And in case the Affairs there should be in such
a Posture, that you cannot go in Person upon this Expedition, you shall
appoint another of sufficient Experience, and well quallify&rsquo;d, to
take the whole Command, for I impower you so to do. And it is my Will,
That in Case you should miscarry, either going upon the Expedition, or
thro&rsquo; any other Accident, or the Person you shall appoint for it,
that then the</i> <span class="marginnote">John de Esquivel <i>to
succeed</i> Don Pedro.</span> <i>Vice-Admiral</i> John de Esquivel
<i>succeed and prosecute it; and that all such as go upon the said
Expedition, as well as Seamen and Landmen, obey him, as they would you,
if there. And I declare that in this Case, and if you should miscarry,
and the said</i> John de Esquivel <i>succeed in the Command of the
Expedition, he shall be subject and subordinate to my Royal Sovereign
Court of those Islands. I have made Choice of the Captains, who have
the Command of the Foot rais&rsquo;d in those Kingdoms, as Persons of
Merit and Service; and therefore do command you to honour and favour
them as far as may be allowable, and in so doing you will please me;
and that you do not reform them, nor take away their Companies, to give
them to others, unless it be to advance them to higher Posts.
Nevertheless, if they shall be guilty of any Crimes, you may punish
them, as their Superior Officer. It is to be suppos&rsquo;d, That when
these Men come to those Islands, and they shall set out in the first
Ships that sail from</i> New Spain<i>, after the Arrival of the</i>
Flota<i>, you will have all Things in such Forwardness, that the
Enterprize may be</i> <span class="marginnote"><i>Charge of Martial
Discipline,</i> &amp;c.</span> <i>gone upon immediately. I charge you
strictly to undertake it with all the Precaution, Maturity, and
Consideration I can expect from so able a Soldier; and that the Men be
well disciplin&rsquo;d and exercis&rsquo;d, and all Things so well
dispos&rsquo;d, that you may meet with the wish&rsquo;d Success, which
is of such Consequence, and you are sensible how much is hazarded, and
of the great Expence that is made. You are to take Care, as I charge
you, that the necessary Order be taken in the Distribution and
Management of my Treasure; and that all superfluous Charges be avoided.
You shall from Time to Time give me an Account of whatsoever happens,
as Occasion shall offer. When you have recover&rsquo;d the Fort of</i>
Ternate<i>, you shall take the necessary Measures for the Security of
the same, and of the Island. I have order&rsquo;d the Viceroy of</i>
New Spain <i>to send you Advice, as soon as the Men that go from hence
arrive there, if there be conveniency so to do; and that he
particularly inform you of what Force he has gather&rsquo;d there, and
will be effective any other Way; as also when they shall sail thence,
that you may dispose Things there accordingly; and if you shall think
fit that the Men be left any where, before they come to</i> Manila<i>,
you may order it, or do as you shall think most Expedient in all
Respects.</i> Valladolid, <i>June the 20th 1604.</i> <span class=

<p>After the Dispatching of this Order, or Letter, the Contents of it
began to be executed in <i>Spain</i>. In the foregoing Year 1603,
whilst <i>Don Pedro</i> <span class="marginnote"><i>Dreadful Fire
at</i> Manila.</span> <i>de Acunna</i> was busy in making Preparations
to this Effect, an Accident happen&rsquo;d in the <i>Philippine</i>
Islands, which threatned the Ruin of them, and greater Calamaties. A
Fire broke out at <i>Manila</i> in <i>April</i>, which consum&rsquo;d
the best Part, and above half the City, without being able to save the
Goods, which had been landed from the Ships newly arriv&rsquo;d from
<i>New Spain</i>, and laid up in the safest Part of the Houses, whereof
270 of Timber and Stone were burnt, as also the Monastery of <i>S.
Dominick</i>, House and Church, the Royal Hospital of the
<i>Spaniards</i>, and the Magazines, no Building that lay betwixt them
escaping. Fourteen <i>Spaniards</i> were burnt, and among them, the
licenciate <i>Sanz</i>, a Canon of the Cathedral, with some
<i>Indians</i> and <i>Blacks</i>. The Loss was valu&rsquo;d at a
Million. It seem&rsquo;d to be an Omen of what was to follow, which
agreed with the Signs seen in the Sky.</p>
<p>In the foregoing <i>March</i>, a <i>Chinese</i> Ship came into the
Bay of <i>Manila</i>, <span class="marginnote"><i>Three</i> Chinese
Mandarines <i>at</i> Manila.</span> in which, as the Out-Guards gave
the Account, there came three great <i>Mandarines</i>, with suitable
Pomp and Retinue, about their Monarch&rsquo;s Business. The Governour
gave them leave to land, and come into the City. As soon as landed,
they were carry&rsquo;d directly to the King&rsquo;s House, in
<i>Palankines</i> of Ivory, and curious Sorts of Wood gilt, on the
Shoulders of their Servants, who were clad in Red. There the Governour
expected them, with the Members of the Royal Court, and a great Number
of Officers and Soldiers, who also lin&rsquo;d the Streets, and publick
Places. When they came to the House, they were set down by their
Servants, and leaving their Colours, Umbrelloes, Launces, and other
Tokens of Grandeur, went into a spacious Room magnificently
adorn&rsquo;d. As soon as they saw the Governour, who expected them
standing, the <i>Mandarines</i>, making their Obeysance, and performing
Ceremonies of Civility after the <i>Chinese</i> Fashion, made up to
him. <i>Don Pedro</i> return&rsquo;d their Courtesy after the Manner of
<i>Spain</i>. They, pursuant to their Commission, with the
Interposition <span class="marginnote"><i>Their Extraordinary
Message.</i></span> of Interpreters, told him; &ldquo;That their King
had sent them with a <i>Chinese</i>, they brought along with them in
Chains, that they might with their own Eyes see a Golden Island,
call&rsquo;d <i>Cabit</i>, near <i>Manila</i>, of which that Subject of
his had given him an Account, telling him, it was not possess&rsquo;d
by any Body, and therefore ask&rsquo;d of him a Number of Ships, to
seize it, promising to bring them back loaden with Gold, and if he did
not he should take his Head. That they were come to fulfill that
Promise to their King, and to satisfy him of the Truth of the Existence
of so strange an Island; which being an Affair of such Consequence,
their King would not commit it to any Persons of less Note than
themselves.<span class="corr" id="xd21e24693" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> <i>Don Pedro de Acunna</i>
answer&rsquo;d them in a few <span class="marginnote">Don Pedro&rsquo;s
<i>Answer</i>.</span> Words. &ldquo;That they were Welcome; that they
might rest them in the House prepar&rsquo;d for their Entertainment in
the City, and they would afterwards discourse about that Affair more at
Leisure. Thus they took their Leave, and at the Door got up again into
their <i>Palankines</i>, on the Shoulders of their Slaves, who
carry&rsquo;d them to their Lodgings. There the Governour order&rsquo;d
them to be plentifully furnish&rsquo;d with Provisions, and all
Dainties as long as they staid. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212"
href="#pb212" name="pb212">212</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is a plain Case, that the coming of these <i>Mandarines</i> must
raise a Jealousy, <span class="marginnote"><i>Jealousy of the</i>
Chineses.</span> and make it be concluded, that they came upon another
Design, than what they declar&rsquo;d. The <i>Chineses</i> are sharp
and mistrustful, and it was not to be believ&rsquo;d, that their King
should send them on that Errand, nor the Fiction likely to be credited
by the <i>Spaniards</i>. At the same Time, eight <i>Chinese</i> Ships
arriv&rsquo;d at <i>Manila</i> with Merchandize, and declar&rsquo;d,
That the <i>Mandarines</i> come as Spies, because the King of
<i>China</i> intended to break off all Trade with the <i>Spaniards</i>,
and send over a mighty Fleet of Ships that could carry an hundred
Thousand fighting Men, to possess himself of that Place, and that this
Expedition would be some time that Year. The Governour redoubled his
Care for the Security of the City, and order&rsquo;d the
<i>Mandarines</i> to be well treated, but not to be suffer&rsquo;d to
go out of the City, nor to administer Justice among the
<i>Sangleys</i>, or <i>Chineses</i>, as they had began to do, which
they seem&rsquo;d to resent. Then he sent them Word, that they must
dispatch their Business, and return speedily to <i>China</i>. All this
was done, without any Signs of Jealousy shown by the <i>Spaniards</i>,
or that they saw into their private Designs.</p>
<p>The <i>Mandarines</i> visited the Governour again, and then he was
more <span class="marginnote"><i>Second Visit of the</i> Mandarines,
<i>and the Governour&rsquo;s Answers</i>.</span> plain; and making
something of a Jest of their Coming, said to them, That he
wonder&rsquo;d their King should give Credit to the <i>Chinese</i> they
brought Prisoner; or if it had been true that any such Gold were in the
<i>Philippine</i> Islands, that he should think the <i>Spaniards</i>
would suffer it to be carry&rsquo;d away, the Country belonging, as it
did, to the King of <i>Spain</i>. The <i>Mandarines</i> answer&rsquo;d
they believ&rsquo;d as much; but that their King had sent them, and
they were oblig&rsquo;d to come, and to carry him an Answer. That
having done their Part, according to their Duty, they would return. The
Governour being willing to make short Work of it, sent the
<i>Mandarines</i>, with their Prisoner and Servants to the Port of
<i>Cabite</i>, which is two Leagues from the City. There they were
receiv&rsquo;d with the Noise of our Cannon, purposely fir&rsquo;d at
their Landing, which they admir&rsquo;d, and did not conceal their
Surprise and Fear. When landed they ask&rsquo;d the Prisoner,
<span class="marginnote"><i>The</i> Chinese <i>Prisoner prov&rsquo;d a
Cheat</i>.</span> whether that was the Island he had told the King of:
He, nothing daunted, answer&rsquo;d, It was. They reply&rsquo;d, Then
where is the Gold? All that is in it, rejoyn&rsquo;d he, is Gold, and I
will make it good. The same Answer he made to several other Questions
put to him; and all was writ down in the Presence of some
<i>Spanish</i> Commanders, and trusty <i>Naguatatoes</i>, or
Interpreters. To conclude, the <i>Mandarines</i> order&rsquo;d a Basket
made of Palm-Tree Leaves to be fill&rsquo;d with that Earth, to carry
it to the King of <i>China</i>; and after dining and resting,
return&rsquo;d to <i>Manila</i>. The <i>Naguatatoes</i> or
Interpreters, declar&rsquo;d, That the <i>Mandarines</i> pressing the
Prisoner to answer directly to the Purpose, he told them, That the
meaning of what he said to the King was, that there was abundance of
Gold, and other Wealth in the <span class="marginnote"><i>He explains
himself.</i></span> Possession of the <i>Spaniards</i> and Natives of
the <i>Philippine</i> Islands; and if he would furnish him with a Fleet
well mann&rsquo;d, he having been at <i>Luzon</i>, and knowing the
Country, would undertake to make himself Master of it, and return to
<i>China</i> with the Ships laden with Gold. This, with what the
<i>Chineses</i> had said before, seem&rsquo;d more likely than the
Invention of the <i>Mandarines</i>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb213" href="#pb213" name="pb213">213</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>Don F. Michael de Benavides</i>, then Archbishop Elect of
<i>Manila</i>, who understood the <i>Chinese</i> Language, was of this
Opinion. He had been in their Country, was acquainted with the
Subtilties of the <i>Sangleyes</i>, and suffer&rsquo;d their Torments
and Cruelties. It was presently Judg&rsquo;d, that the
<i>Mandarines</i> came under that Colour to view the Country, and to
lay the Foundation of their Insurrection and Mutiny there. These
certain Judgments are grounded on the Irrational Disposition of the
<i>Sangleyes</i>, or <i>Chineses</i>, which, not to mention other
Proofs, will sufficiently appear, by some few <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Part of a Letter concerning the</i>
Chineses.</span>Periods of the Long Letter <i>Ferdinand de los
Rios</i>, of whom we have spoken before, writ to <i>Manila</i>, from
the Port of <i>Pinar</i> in <i>Canton</i>, where he was upon the
Service of the Church, and of his King. <i>For these Infidels</i>, says
he, <i>have the Light of Nature more clouded than any other People in
the World, and therefore there is need of Angels, and not Men, to deal
with them. For the better conceiving what a sort of Country &rsquo;tis
we are in, I shall only say, that this is the true Kingdom of the
Devil, and where he may be said to govern with absolute Power.
Every</i> Sangley<i>, or</i> Chinese<i>, seems to be possess&rsquo;d by
him; for there is no piece of Malice, or Fraud, but what they attempt.
The Government, tho&rsquo; outwardly it appears good, as to Order and
Method, for its Security; yet when you once have Experience of its
Practice, you will find it is all a Contrivance of the Devil.
Tho&rsquo; they do not here publickly rob, or plunder Strangers, they
do it another worse Way</i>, &amp;c.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Chineses <i>design the Conquest of the</i>
Philippines.</span> This Jealousy conceiv&rsquo;d against the
<i>Sangleyes</i>, who, once for all, are the Chineses so call&rsquo;d
by the <i>Spaniards</i> at <i>Manila</i>, was verify&rsquo;d; for it
was afterwards known, that the Captain of the King of
<i>China</i>&rsquo;s Guards had begg&rsquo;d of him the Conquest of the
<i>Philippine</i> Islands, at the Perswasion of that <i>Chinese</i>
they brought Prisoner. The Governour treated the <i>Mandarines</i>
civilly, and mistrusted their Designs, keeping a watchfull Eye over
them. However there wanted not some-body that ask&rsquo;d them, what
they thought of that Fellow&rsquo;s Invention, since they had seen that
the Place he mention&rsquo;d was so far from having any Gold, that
there were not the least Tokens of any such Thing to be found in it;
and since it was so, they ought to make him give it under his Hand,
that he had told his King a Lye. One of the <i>Mandarines</i> bid him
do so, and he taking the Pen form&rsquo;d <span class=
"marginnote"><i>The Prisoners Declaration.</i></span> three Characters,
which, explain&rsquo;d in our Tongue, signify&rsquo;d, <i>If the King
pleases, it is Gold; and if not, it is Sand.</i> Being press&rsquo;d
farther, he declared, That he had inform&rsquo;d his King that Gold was
produc&rsquo;d there to incline his Majesty to entrust him with a good
Fleet, wherewith he might take Revenge of the Christian
<i>Sangleyes</i>, who had done him many Wrongs. Little Notice was taken
of all this, and tho&rsquo; the Authority of the <i>Mandarines</i>
seem&rsquo;d to corroborate it, all was look&rsquo;d upon as Folly, for
none believ&rsquo;d that they design&rsquo;d to carry on a War out of
their Country. The <i>Mandarines</i> return&rsquo;d Home, having, as is
believ&rsquo;d, communicated their Project to the <i>Sangleyes</i> that
were settled there, who at <i>Manila</i>, and in the other Islands,
were above 30000.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Chineses <i>take</i> Aynan <i>by
Treachery.</i></span> The same was practis&rsquo;d by the
<i>Chinese</i> King in the Island of <i>Aynao</i>, or <i>Aynan</i>, a
most fruitful Country, and near to his Kingdom, where the
<i>Chineses</i> crept in under Colour of Trade, as they did at
<i>Manila</i>, and possess&rsquo;d themselves of it to this Day. This
Island has such a plentiful Pearl Fishery, that in the Year 1600 the
King caus&rsquo;d 1500 <i>Arrobas</i>, that is, 375 Hundred
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214" name=
"pb214">214</a>]</span>Weight of them to be taken up. This will not
seem incredible to such as know, that not long before, in four Months
Time, he gather&rsquo;d 1700 <span class="marginnote"><i>Monstrous
Quantity of Pearls.</i></span> Vessels that row&rsquo;d, for this
Fishery, every one being oblig&rsquo;d to take a <i>Pico</i>, that is,
five <i>Arrobas</i>, or Quarters of an Hundred, to gather a sufficient
Quantity of Pearls to rebuil&rsquo;d a Royal Apartment that had been
pull&rsquo;d down in that King&rsquo;s Palace. He built it again,
covering the Walls and Roofs with Clusters of Pearls, and Birds,
Beasts, Fruits, and Flowers, all made of that precious Substance, set
on Plates of Gold. The Truth of this Fact appears by an Authentick
Writing, which gives an Account of it; for being likely to be
judg&rsquo;d Fabulous, it was requisite to authorize the Relation.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Precautions taken at</i> Manila.</span>
The Governour did not altogether look upon the Design of the
<i>Mandarines</i> as a Piece of Vanity and Folly, tho&rsquo; he
conceal&rsquo;d his Thoughts; for he made some Preparations, and among
the rest hasten&rsquo;d the repairing of the Walls of the City; which
having suffer&rsquo;d much by the Fire, when the Arms were also lost,
he made up that Defect the best he could, and the <i>Sangleyes</i> were
assisting in it. It is to be observ&rsquo;d, that those People have a
separate Government among themselves, in the <i>Philippine</i>
Islands.</p>
<p>At the Time that <i>Don Pedro</i>, the Governour, was most intent
upon the War against the <i>Molucco</i> Islands, there happen&rsquo;d
such an Accident at <i>Manila</i>, as <span class="marginnote">Encan
<i>a</i> Chinese <i>of great Subtilty.</i></span> might not only have
diverted it, but utterly destroy&rsquo;d the whole Province. A Man was
then living, who stay&rsquo;d at <i>Manila</i>, when the great Pyrate
<i>Limaon</i>, of whose Life and Actions there are Printed Relations,
came to <i>Manila</i>. He was then an Idolater, and, as was reported,
serv&rsquo;d the Pyrate in a leud Capacity. His Name was <i>Encan</i>,
born at <i>Semygua</i>, in the Province of <i>Chincheo</i>; and was
baptiz&rsquo;d under the Government of <i>Santiago de Vera</i>, who
gave him his Surname, and he was call&rsquo;d <i>Baptist de Vera</i>.
He prov&rsquo;d a subtile Dealer, and successfully Active, by which
Means, following Trade, he gather&rsquo;d immense Wealth, and was Great
with the Governours of the <i>Philippines</i>. Through his
Interposition, the <i>Sangleyes</i> propos&rsquo;d to <i>Don Pedro</i>,
that he should allow them to repair a Parapet of the Wall, which was
finishing, at their own Expence; for that they, as a Part of the
Publick, would do his Majesty that Piece of Service; and every one of
them offer&rsquo;d four Royals, that is, two Shillings, towards the
Work. This Piece of Service, and the Favour of the Citizens,
<i>Encan</i> had purchas&rsquo;d by good Turns, made the Suspicion
conceiv&rsquo;d of their Conspiracy vanish, or at least be little
regarded.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>His crafty Practices.</i></span> He was
respected by the <i>Spaniards</i>, and belov&rsquo;d by the
<i>Sangleyes</i>, had been their Governour several Times, and had many
Godsons, and other Dependants. At this Time he cunningly kept within
the City, to secure Things by his Presence; but from thence he
stirr&rsquo;d up the People, and laid his Design, by Means of his
Confidents. He thought fit to know what Number of People he should find
to put it in Execution, and that he might muster them in private,
order&rsquo;d that every one of his Country-Men should bring him a
Needle; pretending he had Occasion for them for some Work. The
<i>Sangleyes</i>, either guessing at the End for which these Needles
were gather&rsquo;d, or else ignorantly obey&rsquo;d <i>Encan</i>. The
Needles being put into a little Box, the Number of them was so great,
that it encourag&rsquo;d him to undertake a far different Work than he
had propos&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>The Governour still forwarded the Work of the Walls; rais&rsquo;d
Men; and directed the Justices to furnish themselves with Provisions,
and Arms, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name=
"pb215">215</a>]</span>to relieve the City. Near the <i>Parian</i>,
which is the Quarters of the <i>Chineses</i>, <span class=
"marginnote">Don Pedro <i>strengthens himself.</i></span> there was
another Ward, inhabited by <i>Japoneses</i>, who are Enemies to the
<i>Sangleyes</i>, with whom they are continually at War in their own
Country. The Governour summon&rsquo;d the Heads of them, and artfully
div&rsquo;d into their Inclinations, to discover, what Use he might
make of them upon Occasion, and whether they would assist him against
the <i>Chineses</i>, in Case <span class="marginnote">Japoneses
<i>promise to assist the</i> Spaniards, <i>and alarm the</i>
Chineses.</span> they came to a War. The <i>Japoneses</i>, proud of the
Confidence he repos&rsquo;d in them, and of an Opportunity of serving
against their Enemy, answer&rsquo;d, they were ready to dye with the
<i>Spaniards</i>. This discreet Precaution occasion&rsquo;d some Harm,
for the <i>Japoneses</i> revealing the Secret, or adding some
Circumstances in the Relation, it was given out, that <i>Don Pedro</i>,
with their Assistance, intended to cut off the <i>Sangleyes</i>; and
some of the <i>Japoneses</i> told them as much, that they might fly,
and reward them for the Intelligence. Many of them had Thoughts of
absconding in the Mountains, the Rest were frighted, and those who
intended to revolt, found an Opportunity to perswade the others to joyn
with them, and encourag&rsquo;d the unsettled with fair Promises. In
short, most of them consented to the Rebellion, and appointed <i>S.
Francis</i>&rsquo;s Day, when the Christians were all at Church,
<span class="marginnote"><i>Conspiracy of the</i> Chineses.</span>
celebrating that Festival, for the Time of rising. Others were for
having it done at Night, when 25000 of them were to break in and murder
our Men.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding their Secrecy some Discovery was made. <i>John de
Talavera</i>, <span class="marginnote"><i>Discovery of it.</i></span>
Curate of the Village of <i>Quiapo</i>, inform&rsquo;d the Arch-Bishop,
that an <i>Indian</i> Woman, with whom a <i>Sangley</i>, or
<i>Chinese</i>, was in Love, had discover&rsquo;d to him the Plot laid
for <i>S. Francis</i>&rsquo;s Day. It was also reported, that a
Woman-Black had said, there would be a great Slaughter, and another
Conflagration, like the former, on <i>S. Francis</i>&rsquo;s Night.
These and other Advices were presently made known to the Governour and
Council. A sufficient Proof was to see the <i>Chineses</i> sell all, to
their very Shoes, and compound their Debts, tho&rsquo; this was rather
lookt upon as a Design to <span class="marginnote"><i>The
Governour&rsquo;s Precautions.</i></span> be gone, than to commit any
Treason. To dispell their Fear of the <i>Spaniards</i> and
<i>Japoneses</i>, the Governour made them some Speeches himself, and
caus&rsquo;d the same to be proclaim&rsquo;d in all Parts, ingaging the
King&rsquo;s Faith and Security; but nothing was of Force to quiet
them. Three Days before the Feast of <i>S. Francis</i>, above 400
<i>Anhayes</i> Merchants stay&rsquo;d in the City, because they could
not dispose of their Goods. These seeing the others in Disorder, on
Account of the Report, that the <i>Spaniards</i> and <i>Japoneses</i>
design&rsquo;d to massacre them, sent a Message to the Governour, by
<i>Chican</i>, <span class="marginnote">Anhayes <i>in Fear,
assur&rsquo;d.</i></span> one of the Province of <i>Anhay</i>, or
<i>Chincheo</i>, whereof that City is Head. He came to him by Night,
for Fear of the other <i>Chineses</i>; and acquainted him with the
Dread, and Confusion they were in, without knowing what Course to take,
and therefore they came to him for Advice and Protection. He having
hear&rsquo;d him, gave all possible Security in his Answer, and the
next Day went himself to talk to his Companions, whom he
satisfy&rsquo;d in a very obliging Manner, assuring them, that the
<i>Spanish</i> Nation never was guilty of executing, or consenting to
such Villanies. This Discourse satisfy&rsquo;d them; but still those
who had Mischief in their Hearts did not desist.</p>
<p>The <i>Sangleyes</i>, or <i>Chineses</i> live there in a separate
Quarter, which the <i>Arabs</i> call <i>Alcayceria</i>, and the People
of the <i>Philippines</i>, <i>Parian</i>. On <i>S. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name=
"pb216">216</a>]</span>Francis</i>&rsquo;s Eve, a great Number of them
met in a House half a League from <span class="marginnote">Parian
<i>the</i> Chinese <i>Quarter</i>.</span> the City, where there is a
Sugar Work: The House stands in a Thicket, which belongs to the
<i>Sangley</i> Governour. Those who began first to gather there, were
the Gardiners of the Quarter of <i>Parian</i>. <i>Don Lewis Perez
<span class="marginnote"><i>First meeting of the mutinous</i>
Chineses.</span> de las Marinhas</i> had Advice of it, from the
<i>Dominicans</i> of <i>Minondo</i>. <i>Don Lewis</i> had Charge of the
Christian <i>Sangleyes</i>, and sent Word to <i>Don Pedro de
Acunna</i>. <i>Minondo</i> is a Town inhabited by <i>Chineses</i>
opposite to <i>Manila</i>, the River only parting them. From
<i>Minondo</i> the <i>Chinese</i> Dwellings run on, as far as another
Town of the Natives, call&rsquo;d <i>Tondo</i>; and in the <span class=
"marginnote">Minondo <i>a Town of</i> Chineses.</span> Quarter of the
<i>Chineses</i>, there is a strong Monastery of <i>Augustinians</i>,
all of Stone. Not far from it the <i>Dominicans</i> have two, but
wooden Buildings. The Governour, to be fully inform&rsquo;d of the
whole Truth, sent thither <i>Baptist</i> <span class="marginnote">Tondo
<i>a Town of Natives.</i></span> before mention&rsquo;d, Governour of
the <i>Sangleyes</i>, of whom he had a great Opinion, and all Men lookt
upon him as a sincere Christian, and loyal Subject to the King. He
charg&rsquo;d him to speak to them in his Name, and to convince
<span class="marginnote"><i>Baptist, the</i> Chinese <i>Governour sent
to appease them.</i></span> them how little Cause they had to fear, as
knowing how peaceable the <i>Spaniards</i> were. <i>Baptist</i>
undertook this Commission, went to the Sugar Work, which was his own,
spoke to his People as he thought fit, and return&rsquo;d very late
with the Answer, telling <i>Don Pedro</i>, that he had been in Danger
of being chosen their Chief, and that his People would have
forc&rsquo;d him to accept of it. That it was true, they were assembled
together, and strong, but that it was all occasion&rsquo;d by the Fear
they had conceiv&rsquo;d of the <i>Spaniards</i>; and that they had
display&rsquo;d several Colours with <i>Chinese</i> Characters on them,
which, being translated, contain&rsquo;d these Words.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Inscription on the</i> Chinese <i>Rebels
Colours.</i></span> <i>&rsquo;The Chief and General of the Kingdom
of</i> China, <i>call&rsquo;d</i> Ezequi, <i>and another of the Tribe
of</i> Su, <i>call&rsquo;d</i> Tym, <i>following the Dictates of Heaven
in this Affair, that all the</i> Chineses <i>may unanimously joyn in
this Work, and obey them, in Order to root out these Enemy Robbers, are
willing that</i> Yochume <i>and</i> Quinte, Japoneses, <i>in
Conjunction with us</i> Sangleyes, <i>do conquer this City, and when we
have subdu&rsquo;d it, we will divide this Country, even to the Grass
of it, equally between us, as becomes loving Brothers.</i></p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Falshood of</i> Baptist.</span> He
pretended to be mightily concern&rsquo;d, because they would have
proclaim&rsquo;d him King, and he was forc&rsquo;d to make his Escape
to save his Loyalty; and had deceiv&rsquo;d them, promising to return.
Hereupon the Governour us&rsquo;d several Means to appease them, the
Danger of so furious a Beginning increasing with the Number of the
Rebells. The first Mischief he endeavour&rsquo;d to prevent was the
destroying of the Rice, which was then almost ripe. He appointed
Colonel <i>Augustin de Arceo</i>, Major <i>Christopher de Azcueta</i>,
and Captain <i>Gallinato</i> to go speak to them; but <i>Don Lewis
Perez de la Marinhas</i>, who liv&rsquo;d at <i>Minondo</i> thinking
the Rebellion now requir&rsquo;d some harsher Remedy, came at Night to
advise the Governour to be more watchful, and that all the City should
do the like. He desir&rsquo;d he would allow him some Men to secure
that Town, for he fear&rsquo;d the <i>Sangleyes</i> would burn it that
Night, and it was now requisite to make open War; and he must not
believe they could be reduc&rsquo;d by Messages, or fair Means. The
<span class="marginnote">Don Lewis Perez <i>secures Minondo.</i></span>
Governour being impos&rsquo;d upon by <i>Baptist</i>, still hop&rsquo;d
all would be compos&rsquo;d without Effusion of Blood, and at the
Perswasion of <i>Don Lewis</i> gave him 20 Soldiers, his own Servants,
and some marry&rsquo;d <i>Spaniards</i>, who were Inhabitants of the
same Town. He distributed these Men into the most dangerous Posts of
it, that the Enemy might not set Fire to it, and the Christian
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name=
"pb217">217</a>]</span><i>Sangleyes</i> when they lost their Goods,
joyn&rsquo;d the Rebels. On the other Hand, the Governour privately
posted his Troops, and Sentinels; and all Men expected, or dreaded the
Fate of that Night, particularly the General <i>John de Alcega</i>,
who, by the Governor&rsquo;s Command, was to follow the Orders he
receiv&rsquo;d from <i>Don Lewis</i>. Proclamation was again made, that
all Men should be peaceable, under Penalty of being sent to the Galleys
for four Years.</p>
<p>This avail&rsquo;d so little, that, excepting 4000 Handicrafts Men,
and the <i>Anhayes</i> <span class="marginnote">1000 Sangleyes
<i>salley.</i></span> Merchants, all the Rest assembled at the Sugar
Work. At one in the Morning, a Party of about 1000 <i>Sangleyes</i>
march&rsquo;d out of a Fort, with <i>Catanas</i>, or Cymiters,
Halbards, and other Weapons advanc&rsquo;d, as also with long Staves,
harden&rsquo;d at the Fire at the Points; which they use instead of
Pikes, and are no less serviceable. These are very frequent among them
in their Country, and are made of a solid Sort of Wood, call&rsquo;d
<i>Mangle</i>. They fell upon the Farm, or Pleasure House of Captain
<i>Stephen de Marquina</i>, not far from their <i>Parian</i>, and
murder&rsquo;d him, his Wife, Children, Servants, <span class=
"marginnote"><i>They murder several and burn Houses.</i></span> and
Slaves. They set Fire to the House, and to those of other
<i>Spaniards</i>, among which were those of Colonel <i>Peter de
Chaves</i>, and of two Clergymen, who liv&rsquo;d a retir&rsquo;d Life,
their Names <i>Francis Gomez</i>, and <i>Ferdinand de los Rios</i>.
They also kill&rsquo;d <i>F. Barnard de Santa Catalina</i>, Commissary
of the Inquisition, of the Order of <i>S. Dominick</i>. All these
defended themselves, as did many more who escap&rsquo;d, desperately
wounded. Thence they drew towards the Town of <i>Tondo</i>, which is
divided into Quarters. They fell upon that of <i>Quiapo</i>, and set
Fire to it, after murdering 20 Persons. <span class=
"marginnote"><i>More Cruelties.</i></span> Among the Rest they burnt a
Lady of Quality, and a Boy, giving great Shouts, and boasting that from
thence forward, the <i>Indians</i> should pay Tribute to them, and the
<i>Castillas</i> perish.</p>
<p>News being brought on <i>Saturday</i> Morning, that the
<i>Sangleyes</i> were going to enter the Town, and that the Natives had
withdrawn themselves in their Vessels toward <i>Manila</i>, in Order to
get in, or lye under the Shelter of its Walls in the River, the
Governour dispos&rsquo;d the Regular Troops, and those of the City
<i>Militia</i> about the Walls, viewing the Gates, and all weak Places.
<span class="marginnote"><i>Captain</i> Perez <i>sent to</i>
Tondo.</span> He sent Captain <i>Gaspar Perez</i> with his regular
Company to <i>Tondo</i>, and order&rsquo;d him to obey <i>Don Lewis de
las Marinhas</i>, and to carry no Colours. As soon as he came, the 20
Men sent the Night before, joyn&rsquo;d him, and <i>Don Lewis</i>
thinking that too small a Force, sent to desire Succours. The Governour
knowing he was in the right, sent the Captain <i>Don Thomas Bravo</i>,
his own Nephew, 24 Years of Age, who serv&rsquo;d at <i>Ternate</i> in
the <span class="marginnote"><i>Captain</i> Thomas Bravo <i>Succours
him.</i></span> Expedition of <i>Andrew Furtado</i>. He went over to
the Town of <i>Tondo</i>, with another Company of the regular Forces,
some Voluntiers, and seven of the Governour&rsquo;s Servants, leaving
the Colours in the City. After him he sent Captain <i>Peter de
Arcea</i>, an old Low-Country Soldier. <i>Don Lewis</i> sent Word
again, that the <i>Chineses</i> were marching towards <i>Tondo</i>,
that they were Numerous, and he fear&rsquo;d they would burn the Town,
and a stately Church of the <i>Augustinians</i>. The Governour sent him
60 Men more, most of them arm&rsquo;d with Pikes, and Halbards, the
first having been Musketiers. These were commanded by <i>Don John de
Penna</i>, till he deliver&rsquo;d them to <i>Don Lewis</i>. When this
Company came, there had been an Ingagement at <i>Tondo</i>, wherein
<i>Don Lewis</i> slew abundance of <i>Sangleyes</i>, and oblig&rsquo;d
the rest to retire; preventing their burning the Town, which began to
take Fire, and the Houses at the Entrance of it were consum&rsquo;d.
<i>Don Lewis</i> would have pursu&rsquo;d the Enemy, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name="pb218">218</a>]</span>who
retir&rsquo;d to their Fort, and <i>Don Thomas Bravo</i>
endeavour&rsquo;d to disswade <span class="marginnote"><i>Chineses
repuls&rsquo;d.</i></span> him, saying, The Men were all
fatigu&rsquo;d, and that as soon as out of the Town they would meet
with nothing but Bogs and Brambles; and since the Governor&rsquo;s
Orders extended no farther than to keep the Enemy off from thence, and
save the burning of the Church and Houses, and that had been done, they
ought to send him Advice of it, before they proceeded, being only the
River parted them, and in the mean while the Soldiers would refresh
themselves, and they might hear more of the Enemies Design. Captain
<i>Alcega</i> said the same, but <i>Don Lewis</i> being bent upon it,
and offended to be <span class="marginnote">Don Lewis <i>upbraids
Captain</i> Alcega.</span> contradicted, ask&rsquo;d him, <i>What Hen
had cackled in his Ear?</i> And bid them follow him, for five and
twenty Soldiers were enough to deal with all <i>China</i>.
<i>Alcega</i> answer&rsquo;d, <i>He was us&rsquo;d to hear as good
Game-Cocks as himself Crow</i>; yet he would do well to consider what
he did. However, tho&rsquo; <i>F. Farfan</i>, an <i>Augustinian</i>,
earnestly perswaded <i>Don Lewis</i>, falling on his Knees, to do as
they desir&rsquo;d him, and not to go any farther, yet he could not be
prevail&rsquo;d on; but having order&rsquo;d the Captains, <i>Gaspar
Perez</i>, and <i>Peter de Arceo</i>, to secure some Posts with a few
Men, he broke out furiously, and <span class="marginnote"><i>Pursues
the Enemy against Advice.</i></span> began to march, being
follow&rsquo;d by the Men, in Pursuit of the Enemy; who had already
gain&rsquo;d the Road, and they overtook them near the Fort, between
the Bogs and the Fordable Shoals. When they came to the Fort, the
Country open&rsquo;d a little more. Here they began to fall upon the
Enemies Rear, and they perceiving how few the <i>Spaniards</i> were, as
not being above 130, drew up in a Body with two Points, like a Half
Moon, and lay in Ambush among the Grass. The main Body of our Men
march&rsquo;d towards the Fort, and then those who lay in Ambush
rising, enclos&rsquo;d our Men, and fell upon them so furiously with
sharp Stakes, Cymiters, and other Weapons, that they cut them in
Pieces. Head-Pieces of Proof were found batter&rsquo;d with a Stake. A
Musketier, who serv&rsquo;d <i>Don Lewis</i>, reported, that a Company
of <span class="marginnote"><i>Is slaughter&rsquo;d with his
Men.</i></span> <i>Sangleyes</i> fell upon him, who having
enclos&rsquo;d him, laid about so implacably, that they bruiz&rsquo;d
and broke his Legs; after which he fought a considerable Time on his
Knees, till they stun&rsquo;d him with their Staves, against which a
strong Helmet could not defend him. They left the Ensign <i>Francis de
Rebolledo</i> stun&rsquo;d, for Dead, and when the Enemy drew off, he
made a Shift to get up and escape, with his Head cruelly cut, and was
cur&rsquo;d in the City, where he told many Particulars of that
miserable Slaughter, about 30 more escap&rsquo;d, and among them <i>F.
Farfan</i>, who all got off by being in the Rear, and light of Foot.
<i>Don Lewis</i> was kill&rsquo;d there by the same People that had
slain his Father, and with him the General <i>Alcega</i>, <i>Don Thomas
Bravo</i>, Captain <i>Cebrian de Madrid</i>, and only one of all the
Governor&rsquo;s Servants surviv&rsquo;d.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Chineses <i>rejoyce with the</i>
Spaniard<i>&rsquo;s Heads.</i></span> The <i>Sangleyes</i> cut off the
Heads of the Slain, and hoisting them on the Points of their Spears,
run in at their Nostrils, carry&rsquo;d them to present to their
<i>Chinese</i> General, who was in the Fort, and his Name
<i>Hontay</i>. He, and the Rest, view&rsquo;d the Heads, and set them
up with much rejoycing, returning Thanks to Heaven, and the Earth,
according to their Custom, for that Victory; thinking they should meet
with little Opposition from the <i>Spaniards</i> after that.</p>
<p>All this Day, being the Feast of <i>S. Francis</i>, and the next,
the Enemy spent in rejoycing. At <i>Manila</i> they were burning the
Suburbs, and Houses without the Walls, and consider&rsquo;d what Order
they should take against <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href=
"#pb219" name="pb219">219</a>]</span>the <i>Parian</i>; for tho&rsquo;
many Thousands of <i>Sangleyes</i> us&rsquo;d to inhabit it, there were
not then 1500 remaining, and among them 500 <i>Anhayes</i> Merchants, a
peaceable and rich People, of whom there was no mistrust; the rest were
Handicrafts, no Way suspected. About 50 of the others were
secur&rsquo;d, who had their Hair shorn, and were mix&rsquo;d among the
Christian <i>Sangleys</i>. These gave Information, that they had burnt
Monasteries of Religious People in several Places. Some Clergy-Men,
with abundance of Women and Children, secur&rsquo;d themselves in the
Church of <i>S. Francis del</i> <span class="marginnote"><i>Christians
defend themselves in a Belfry.</i></span> <i>Monte</i>, and some
Companies of <i>Sangleyes</i> coming to besiege them, they went up into
a Belfry, where having fixt a Sheet on a Staff, they display&rsquo;d it
like Colours, the People appearing at the Windows, the Women and
Children ringing the Bells, rating the Enemy, and bidding them come on.
Our Men often firing two Muskets, which was all they had, the
<i>Sangleyes</i> durst not approach, being more afraid than they had
Occasion, and accordingly drew off to a strong Post, whence they were
to continue the War.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Francis de las Missas <i>does the Rebels
much Harm.</i></span> The Governour endeavour&rsquo;d to prevent the
News of the Slaughter spreading abroad, lest it should discourage the
Country; and gave out, that the Slain were at <i>S. Francis del
monte</i>. He warn&rsquo;d the Justices to get together all the
<i>Indian</i> Servants, because there were scarce any <i>Spaniards</i>
left; and sent the Factor <i>Francis de las Missas</i> to cruise upon
the Coast, with three Rowing Vessels, towards the Enemies Fort, to cut
off all their Provisions. The Factor perform&rsquo;d his Part so well,
that he sunk some Vessels, and burnt those that carry&rsquo;d them
Provisions. He kill&rsquo;d many of their Men at the Mouth of a River
that falls into the Sea, about the Fort call&rsquo;d <i>Navotas</i>;
look&rsquo;d for the Clergy-men they were said to have kill&rsquo;d in
their Houses; and sent away to <i>S. Francis del monte</i>, a Party of
500 <i>Japoneses</i>, with three <i>Spaniards</i>, and two
<i>Franciscan</i> Fryers, to gather the Remains of that Slaughter. In
his Way, he pass&rsquo;d by the Enemy&rsquo;s Fort, with a Design to do
them some Harm, if he could, and found they had abandon&rsquo;d it,
retiring to the <i>Parian</i>, to joyn the rest and besiege the City,
being puff&rsquo;d up with their late Victory. This happen&rsquo;d on
<i>Monday</i> the 6th. The <span class="marginnote">Japoneses
<i>kill</i> 200 Chineses, <i>and burn their Fort.</i></span>
<i>Japoneses</i> search&rsquo;d the Fort, where they found about 200
sick and wounded <i>Chineses</i>, whom they slew, and saving abundance
of Provisions, burnt the Fort with all their Warlike Preparations,
which could not be serviceable against the first Owners. They went up
to the Monastery, and return&rsquo;d thence the same Day to the
City.</p>
<p>The few <i>Sangleyes</i> in the <i>Parian</i> were no less
apprehensive, than the <span class="marginnote"><i>Rebels send to stir
up the others.</i></span> greater Number in the Fort, both because they
were so near, and for that it was suppos&rsquo;d they would joyn their
Companions, when they saw the <i>Spaniards</i> decline. Besides, it was
known, that those in Rebellion had sent to desire them to come over to
their Party, giving them Notice of the <i>Spaniards</i> they had
kill&rsquo;d. This was discover&rsquo;d by a <i>Sangley</i>, who
swimming over, was taken by the Sentinel on the Vessels that were in
the River, who, having confess&rsquo;d on the Rack, that he was a Spy,
and went <span class="marginnote"><i>Spy executed.</i></span> forward
and backward with Intelligence, was put to Death. On the other Hand, it
was consider&rsquo;d, that though the safest Way was to kill all those
People, yet it was not just to execute Men that were not convicted of
any Crime; especially since they came to the <i>Philippine</i> Islands,
to trade upon <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name=
"pb220">220</a>]</span>the publick Faith, and the Governour having
engag&rsquo;d for their Safety, in case they were quiet, and
intermeddled not in the Rebellion. For this Reason some Councils of War
were held among the Commanders, at which the Counsellors, and the
Archbishop, were also present; and considering, that the Rebels
earnestly applying to those in the <i>Parian</i>, to side with them, it
was possible they might be perverted, and in case they did not revolt,
<span class="marginnote"><i>The Governour would secure the</i>
Anhayes.</span> those Mutiniers would kill them, it was resolv&rsquo;d,
That the <i>Anhayes</i> Merchants should be perswaded to retire with
their Effects into the Monastery of <i>S. Augustin</i>, which is a
strong House within <i>Manila</i>. The Governour having himself in
Person acquainted them herewith, as also by some of the Counsellors and
their Friends, yet they were irresolute; and tho&rsquo; some of them
committed the keeping of their Goods to others, they stay&rsquo;d
themselves to be Spectators of the Event. The last Care taken of them,
was <i>Don Pedro</i>&rsquo;s going in Person to the <i>Parian</i> that
same Day; and about an Hour after, many of the Enemies Colours
appear&rsquo;d on the other Side of the River, along the Bank of it.
They came from the Fort, which was a quarter of a League from the
City.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Chineses <i>pass over to</i> Parian.</span>
Some of the <i>Sangleyes</i> began to swim over to the <i>Parian</i>,
and others came in Boats and Floats provided for that Purpose. Their
Passage could not be obstructed, because the Galiots and <i>Carcoas</i>
belonging to the Navy were then among the <i>Pintados</i>, to defend
those Islands; Intelligence having been brought, that a Fleet of
<i>Mindanaos</i> and <i>Ternates</i> was coming to invade them. The
Rebels enter&rsquo;d the <i>Parian</i> with great Cries, bringing the
Heads of the <i>Spaniards</i> they had kill&rsquo;d on S.
<i>Francis</i>&rsquo;s Day, run through the Nostrils. The Governour
observing their Resolution, order&rsquo;d the Captains, <i>Gaspar
Perez</i>, and <i>Peter de Arceo</i>, who were at <i>Tondo</i>, to come
over to the City with their Companies. The Enemy being return&rsquo;d
to the <i>Parian</i>, with that dismal Spectacle of the Heads, began to
perswade the <i>Anhayes</i>, who had not yet declar&rsquo;d, but not
being able to prevail, and finding them positive on the contrary, and
that they blam&rsquo;d what they had done, <span class=
"marginnote"><i>The</i> Chineses <i>murder the</i> Anhayes.</span> they
fell upon and butcher&rsquo;d above 200 of them. Then they
plunder&rsquo;d Part of their Silks, which made them Cloaths of several
Colours. They <span class="marginnote"><i>Some hang themselves to avoid
their Fury.</i></span> also hang&rsquo;d other Merchants, and some,
being about 80 in Number, hang&rsquo;d themselves, to prevent falling
into their Hands, which is very frequent in <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e25920" title="Source: theat">that</span> Country. One of these
was the <i>Sangley</i> General himself, call&rsquo;d, <i>Hontay</i>.
<i>F. John Pobre</i>, formerly a Captain, since a <i>Franciscan</i>
Fryer, and at this Time compell&rsquo;d by Necessity to take up Arms
again, reported, That the mutinous <i>Sangleyes</i>, having perswaded
the <i>Anhayes</i> to follow their Example, they appointed
<i>Chican</i>, a rich <i>Sangley</i>, and Master of the <i>Spanish</i>
Tongue, to answer for them. He, before he would speak his Mind, told
them it would be proper to set up a Gallows, and the Heads of the
<i>Spaniards</i> on it, that being in View, they might all take Courage
to fight manfully. They approv&rsquo;d of his Counsel, and the Gallows
being set up, he <span class="marginnote"><i>Strange Death of</i>
Chican.</span> went up himself to range the Heads, and taking out a
Rope he had carry&rsquo;d up unseen, put it about his own Neck, and
hang&rsquo;d himself in the Sight of them all.</p>
<p>The same day Captain <i>Peter de Brito</i>, being with his Company
in the Cathedral, which had been assign&rsquo;d him the Night before,
for his Post, and observing that a certain House was not
uncover&rsquo;d, contrary to the Proclamation <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221" name="pb221">221</a>]</span>made
the Day before, commanding them all to have the Palm-Tree Leaves and
<i>Nipa</i>, wherewith they are thatch&rsquo;d, taken off, for Fear of
another Conflagration; he sent to take it off. The Ensign <i>Andrew
Obregon</i> went up to this Purpose to the very Top, and there found
<i>Baptist</i> hidden with his Sword and Dagger, whom some Women
endeavour&rsquo;d to conceal. Being ask&rsquo;d by the Ensign, what he
did there? he answer&rsquo;d, He was <span class="marginnote">Baptist
<i>Chief of the Rebels taken.</i></span> taking off the <i>Nipa</i>.
The next Question he was quite dash&rsquo;d, and his own Conscience
suddenly accusing him, he said, <i>Do not kill me, Sir.</i> The Ensign
mildly encouraging, bid him go to the Governour, who expected him, and
stay&rsquo;d to take off the Covering of <i>Nipa</i>. Then coming down
saw some Soldiers, and went up again with them. By this Time certain
<i>Indian</i> Women had hid <i>Baptist</i> in a Chamber, where the
Soldiers entering by Force, bound him, and he was cast into Prison
among other <i>Chineses</i>. The Tryal was short, as is usual in the
Martial Way, and in the mean while the Prisoners were remov&rsquo;d to
Captain <i>Gallinato</i>&rsquo;s House. Thither came a <i>Japonese</i>
Boy, enquiring for <i>Baptist</i>. They found his Pocket full of
Squibs, and another Boy with a Piece of a Wax-Candle, all which was
given them by one of <i>Baptist</i>&rsquo;s Slaves. The Squibs were all
bloody, perhaps it was some Christian&rsquo;s Gore. He own&rsquo;d
himself he had <span class="marginnote"><i>His Confession.</i></span>
so great a Hand in the Rebellion, that it was not without good Reason
they would have made him their Chief. That the <i>Sangleys</i>
call&rsquo;d out upon his Name. That <i>Hontay</i> was troubled at his
Absence, saying, He <span class="marginnote"><i>Why</i> Hontay
<i>hang&rsquo;d himself.</i></span> must needs be in some Trouble,
since he did not come to Head them; and for this Reason he hang&rsquo;d
himself. Next appear&rsquo;d the Ring-leaders of the Mutiny, and it was
prov&rsquo;d against them, That they had set up a Pole on the Place
call&rsquo;d <i>el Cerro</i>, or the Hill of <i>Calocan</i>, and on it
a black Flag, with two <i>Chinese</i> Characters on it, which imported
<span class="ex"><i>CUNTIEN</i></span>, the Signification whereof is,
<span class="ex"><i>IN OBEDIENCE TO HEAVEN</i></span>. Other Colours
were found with the Army that fought at <i>Dilao</i>, with a Cut on
them containing the <i>Chinese</i> Figures of <i>Encan</i>, or
<i>Baptist</i>.</p>
<p>Several Religious Men, at this Time fought against the Mutiniers;
but <span class="marginnote"><i>Brother</i> Antony Flores, <i>a brave
Man.</i></span> among them all, special Praise is due to the Valour of
the Lay-Brother <i>Antony Flores</i>, of the Order of <i>S.
Augustin</i>. He was born in <i>Estremadura</i>, had serv&rsquo;d in
<i>Flanders</i>, was a Slave in <i>Turkey</i> above 20 Years, and made
his Escape out of the Inland Country by his Valour and Industry. He
went over to the <i>Philippine</i> Islands, where he chearfully took
the Habit, in the Monastery of <i>S. Augustin</i> at <i>Manila</i>. He
always show&rsquo;d great Humility in Obedience, and lost nothing of
his Courage in the Simplicity of a Religious Life. Him the Governour
order&rsquo;d to scour the River, in the Galliot belonging to the
Monastery, fighting the Ships and <i>Champanes</i> of the
<i>Sangleyes</i>. One Night after having drove from the Shore above 200
Vessels, <span class="marginnote"><i>Does good Service.</i></span>
burnt some large ones, and sunk others, he stay&rsquo;d in the Middle
of the River <i>Passig</i>, to observe the <i>Sangleyes</i>. Between
eleven and twelve, he perceiv&rsquo;d that one of the Rebels was
swimming over to the City, and the Darkness causing him to mistake, he
lighted upon brother <i>Antony</i>&rsquo;s Galliot. <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Takes a Spy.</i></span> He having seen him before, the
<i>Indian</i> Servants had the Opportunity of laying hold of him, drew
him by the Hair into the Galliot, and carry&rsquo;d him to the
Governour. He was put to the Rack, and there confess&rsquo;d, That he
came to acquaint the <i>Sangleyes</i> of the <i>Parian</i>, that the
next Day those <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=
"pb222">222</a>]</span>on the other Side would cross the River, and
then they would all together, with the Engines they had provided,
attack the Wall, put all the <i>Spaniards</i> to the Sword, and make
themselves Masters of the Islands. The Governour having this
Intelligence, took the necessary Precautions for the next Day, and
Brother <i>Antony</i> return&rsquo;d to his Monastery, where he
furnish&rsquo;d himself with Meal and other Provisions for his Galliot.
He carry&rsquo;d two Muskets for himself, and drew his Vessel into a
Creek the River makes, that runs by the Walls of <i>Manila</i>, among
abundance of <i>Manglans</i>, which are Trees growing in any watrey
land, and so thick, that Men may easily be hid among them, without
being perceiv&rsquo;d. There Brother <i>Antony</i> lay in Ambush
supposing, or knowing, that the <i>Sangleyes</i> must of Necessity pass
that Way, <span class="marginnote"><i>He alone kills</i> 600
Chineses.</span> as being the narrowest in the River, and nearest to
the Wall. Nor was he deceiv&rsquo;d in his Expectation, for they came
very early in the Morning, and were passing over in great Numbers from
the first Peep of Day, till very late. The Fryer had put above 200
Bullets into two Pouches, and kept firing the two Muskets from before
five in the Morning, at break of Day till six in the Evening, cooling
them with Vinegar; nor did he ever fire at less than a Company of 20 or
30 <i>Sangleyes</i>, that no Shot might be lost. It was concluded for
certain, that he alone that Day kill&rsquo;d above 600 of those
Barbarians. The Governour afterwards sent him in pursuit of those that
remain&rsquo;d, with a thousand <i>Indians</i>, and he slew above 3000
<i>Sangleyes</i>, putting to flight the small Remains of them.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Desperate</i> Sangleyes <i>kill&rsquo;d
from the Wall.</i></span> At this Time many of the <i>Sangleyes</i>
that had cross&rsquo;d the River, appear&rsquo;d in the Streets of the
<i>Parian</i>; who standing in Sight of the Walls, with their own, or
the Weapons they had taken from the <i>Spaniards</i> they slew,
call&rsquo;d upon those who defended the City, whence they made several
Musket Shot at them, wounding and killing many, for they came within
good Aim, after a desperate Manner. It was reported, they had taken
their <i>Anfion</i>, that is, a Composition of <i>Opium</i>, as the
<i>Turks</i> do, and is also us&rsquo;d by the People of the
<i>Moluccos</i>, when they are to give Battel; for it doses and gives
them a brutal Courage. A Piece of Cannon was planted on the Gate of the
<i>Parian</i>, and did considerable Execution, and no Man <span class=
"marginnote">Opium <i>gives Courage.</i></span> would have suspected
that any had been there. Some <i>Japoneses</i> and Natives of the
<i>Philippines</i> sally&rsquo;d out upon the <i>Sangleyes</i>, with
good Success; for they kill&rsquo;d many of them, and particularly such
as had been wounded by the small Shot, and Brass Guns on the Wall. They
thinking the <i>Parian</i> <span class="marginnote">Japoneses
<i>and</i> Indians <i>fight the</i> Chineses.</span> was a Shelter for
Cowards, set Fire to it, and went out to fight the <i>Japoneses</i> and
<i>Indians</i>. The <i>Sangleyes</i> from the Houses, where they lay
conceal&rsquo;d, kill&rsquo;d a <i>Portuguese</i> Captain, and wounded
three others, with small Shot. One of them was <i>Ruy Gonzalez de
Sequeyra</i>, Commander in Chief of the <i>Moluccos</i>. The
<i>Sangleyes</i> remov&rsquo;d to the Monastery of <i>Candelaria</i>,
that is of <i>Candlemas</i>, whence they sally&rsquo;d more furiously
than from the <i>Parian</i>.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Fight of</i> Spaniards <i>and</i>
Chineses.</span> On <i>Tuesday</i> in the Morning, Captain
<i>Gallinato</i> march&rsquo;d towards the <i>Candelaria</i>, with
about 500 <i>Spaniards</i>, and some <i>Japoneses</i>. The Enemy
refus&rsquo;d not the Engagement, but came out above 4000 strong. Our
Men made themselves Masters of a Bridge, whence they pour&rsquo;d some
Volleys upon them. Perceiving the Loss they sustain&rsquo;d, they fell
back, to draw the <i>Spaniards</i> into open Field, and serve them as
they had done <i>Don Lewis</i>; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223"
href="#pb223" name="pb223">223</a>]</span>but tho&rsquo; some Soldiers
were so bold as to go into the Church, and plunder Part of what the
<i>Sangleyes</i> had robb&rsquo;d in the <i>Parian</i>, yet some of
them <span class="marginnote"><i>Slaughter of the Latter.</i></span>
retir&rsquo;d hastily to the Bridge, with the Loss of three
<i>Spaniards</i>, and five <i>Japoneses</i>, besides the wounded, the
Enemy charging them in a Body. Of the <i>Chineses</i> 360 of the
boldest were kill&rsquo;d, which made them flinch with Fear. The same
Day in the Evening, a Party of them came up to assault the Wall, where
it was lowest, bringing scaling Ladders, and other Necessaries,
cover&rsquo;d with Silk; but the Cannon play&rsquo;d so smartly on
them, that they lost their Ladders, and many of them their Lives. This
same Afternoon there was an Engagement on the Side of the
<i>Parian</i>, where the Enemy brought on two great Machines, like
Carts, made the Night before, with Wheels, and stuff&rsquo;d with
Quilts, Blankets, and such Materials, to defend them against the
Cannon, and small Shot. The Governour was apprehensive that they had
some Fire-works, they being great Masters at them; but was soon
satisfy&rsquo;d, for having fir&rsquo;d at them with the Piece that was
over the Gate of the <i>Parian</i>, where one of his Servants was
Gunner, it carry&rsquo;d away a considerable Part of the foremost
Machine, and with it a good Number of the <i>Sangleyes</i> that drew
underneath, and were on it. However they advanc&rsquo;d boldly, till
the Gun tore others in Pieces, and they retir&rsquo;d, abandoning the
<i>Machine</i>. Still the Fight grew hot about the River, and several
Men went out in Boats, and others did Execution thro&rsquo; the
Loop-Holes. The Ensign <i>John Guerra de Cervantes</i>, <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Their machine destroy&rsquo;d.</i></span> sent out the
<i>Japonese</i> and Native Soldiers, and they drew near to the
<i>Parian</i>, under the Shelter of the Cannon on the Walls, so
courageously, that they set fire to the best of it, being the Houses of
the <i>Anhayes</i>; which quite discourag&rsquo;d those that were in
them, especially when they observ&rsquo;d they <span class=
"marginnote"><i>The</i> Spaniards <i>fire the</i> Parian.</span> had
secur&rsquo;d the River, and the Boats, and taken their Musquetiers. It
was judg&rsquo;d that above 2500 <i>Sangleyes</i> perish&rsquo;d this
Day by Fire and Sword, besides those at the <i>Candelaria</i>, and
other Straglers. Having left the Shelter of the <i>Parian</i>, they
took up in the Church of the <i>Candelaria</i>, but the next Morning
none of them appear&rsquo;d. They cross&rsquo;d the River on
<i>Wednesday</i>, <span class="marginnote"><i>Kill 2500</i>
Chineses.</span> and some of our Men were drowned pursuing them too
eagerly. They took the Way to the Village call&rsquo;d <i>Tabuco</i>, 5
Leagues from <i>Manila</i>, which is very populous, and plentiful. Here
Captain <i>Don Lewis de Velasco</i> found <span class=
"marginnote"><i>They fly.</i></span> them fortify&rsquo;d, and defended
with Doors and Boards, towards the Lake <span class="marginnote"><i>And
are pursu&rsquo;d with great Slaughter.</i></span> <i>Vay</i>; whence
he ply&rsquo;d them with small Shot, and kill&rsquo;d many, they no
longer able to endure the Damage they receiv&rsquo;d, kindled many
Fires in the Night, to prevent being observ&rsquo;d, and march&rsquo;d
away towards S. <i>Paul</i>&rsquo;s, a Village 16 Leagues from
<i>Manila</i>, where they came so thin, that they were not above 6000,
having lost very many in the Way to <i>Tabuco</i>. There <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Capt.</i> Velasco <i>kill&rsquo;d.</i></span> <i>Don
Lewis</i> fell upon them again; and pursuing them after they quitted
the Village, was so hot, that they kill&rsquo;d him four Soldiers, and
two barefoot Fryers, the one a Priest, the other a Lay-Brother.</p>
<p>They made a Halt at S. <i>Paul</i>&rsquo;s, intending to reap the
Rice, which was then almost Ripe, because that is a forwarder Country
than <i>Pampangua</i>. <span class="marginnote"><i>Another Slaughter
of</i> Chineses.</span> Before they came to S. <i>Paul</i>&rsquo;s, a
Detachment of 1500 of them turn&rsquo;d off from the main Body towards
the Mountains of <i>Pace</i>. The <i>Spaniards</i> and Natives overtook
them, and tho&rsquo; they stood to it, our Men play&rsquo;d their Parts
so well, that they cut them all off, and recover&rsquo;d Part of their
Booty. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name=
"pb224">224</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Fort the <i>Sangleyes</i> had rais&rsquo;d at S.
<i>Paul</i>&rsquo;s was of Palm-Trees, whence they made Excursions to
fight, reap the Rice, and ravage the Country. They thought it
convenient to divide themselves into two equal Bodies; the one
stay&rsquo;d in the Fort, the other went away to <i>Vatangas</i>, seven
Leagues distant towards the Sea-Coast, with a Design, as was thought,
to build Ships, for which Purpose they carry&rsquo;d Carpenters,
Labourers, Tools, <span class="marginnote"><i>Rebels design to build
Ships.</i></span> Nails, and all other Necessaries. The Governour
reflecting on their Design, sent some vigilant Persons towards the Bay
of <i>Vatangas</i>, to secure the Vessels on the Coast, that the Enemy
might not make use of them, and get over to other Islands, which would
have been of ill Consequence.</p>
<p>The Governour believing the Design of the <i>Sangleyes</i> was to
gain Time, <span class="marginnote"><i>The Rebels
press&rsquo;d.</i></span> and perhaps to expect some Supplies from
<i>China</i>, which might be promis&rsquo;d by the <i>Mandarines</i>,
before they went away; he thought it requisite to bring the War to a
speedy Conclusion, because the Enemy fortify&rsquo;d themselves daily,
and made Excursions from their Forts, to scour the Country, and gather
in the Rice; perswading the Natives to joyn with them; tho&rsquo; they
were so far from complying, that they kill&rsquo;d all they could meet
with. There were several other Reasons which prov&rsquo;d that the
greatest Safety consisted in Expedition, and therefore abundance of
<i>Spaniards</i> and Natives, by the Governour&rsquo;s Order, were
always in Quest of the straggling <i>Chineses</i>. However it was
judg&rsquo;d expedient to press them yet nearer, and not allow them
Time, as they wish&rsquo;d, till the Rice was ripe, since Hunger must
prove their greatest Enemy. To this Purpose it was thought Expedient to
make use of trusty neighbouring People.</p>
<p><i>Pampangua</i> is a Province ten Leagues from <i>Manila</i>,
beyond the Town of <span class="marginnote">Pampangua
<i>describ&rsquo;d.</i></span> <i>Tondo</i>, over the River
<i>Pasig</i>, on which the Citizens have convenient small Vessels. The
Country is subject to be overflow&rsquo;d, by reason of the many
Rivers, and because the Natives draw Trenches from them, to water the
Rice, and other Grain. The whole District is of twelve Leagues, all
inhabited, and has seven Churches, belonging to the Order of S.
<i>Augustin</i>. The Natives are Brave, Docible and Loyal, receive the
Christian Faith, and are steadfast in it; and richer than those of
other Parts of the Island. Captain <i>Ferdinand de Avalos</i> was
<i>Alcalde mayor</i>, or chief Governour of <i>Pampangua</i>, and the
Governour General having acquainted him by Letter <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Service done by the</i> Alcayde <i>of</i>
Pampangua.</span> with the Rebellion of the <i>Sangleyes</i>, requiring
him to send Provisions and Arms for the War, and not to leave any
Enemies behind, he perform&rsquo;d both Things, with extraordinary
Care. He furnish&rsquo;d him with great Store of Rice, Palm-Wine, and a
considerable Number of Cows and Calves; and took above 400
<i>Sangleyes</i>, who being carry&rsquo;d to a Creek in the River,
bound two and two, and deliver&rsquo;d to the <i>Japoneses</i>, they
slew them all. <i>F. James de Guevara</i> of the Order of S.
<i>Augustin</i>, Prior of <i>Manila</i>, who writ this Relation,
preach&rsquo;d to them first, and only five of them forsook their
Idolatry, and were baptiz&rsquo;d. At the same Time he sent the
Governour 4000 <i>Pampanguos</i>, arm&rsquo;d after their Country
Fashion, with Bows, Arrows, Half-Pikes, Shields, and long broad
Poniards. They came to <i>Manila</i> with great Shouts, and as if sure
of Victory, fell upon the Enemy, who increas&rsquo;d still, the more
they were destroy&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>This obliged the Governour, notwithstanding some Opposition, to send
a Number of <i>Spaniards</i>, and <i>Japoneses</i>, with a strong Party
of the <i>Pampangua <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225"
name="pb225">225</a>]</span>Indians</i>, well arm&rsquo;d and provided,
under the Command of the Captain and Major <i>Azcueta</i>, a brave and
vigilant Commander, well acquainted with the <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Major</i> Azcueta <i>sent against the</i>
Chineses.</span> Country, ordering him to draw near the Enemy; yet not
to engage, because they were a desperate barbarous People in their
first Onsets, but to alarm them Day, and Night, on every Side,
obstructing their Excursions, that so they might want Provisions, and
consequently be oblig&rsquo;d to dislodge, for if he could remove them
but twice, he might cut them off, as it happen&rsquo;d accordingly. The
Major departed <i>Manila</i>, with these Orders, by the Way of the
River. On <i>Munday</i> the 20th of <i>October</i>, he came in Sight of
the Enemy, who was still in the Fort at <i>S. Paul</i>&rsquo;s, and
there he had some Actions. Having cast up some Works, for his greater
Security, in the Quarters he took up, the Enemy&rsquo;s sally&rsquo;d
out of their Fort, and some of those who valu&rsquo;d themselves on
their Bravery advanc&rsquo;d to fight the <i>Spaniards</i> in their
Posts, with as much Boldness, as could be expected from Men in Despair,
and quite distracted. Thus being cut off from Water, streightned, often
alarm&rsquo;d, never suffer&rsquo;d to rest, and such as ventur&rsquo;d
out cut off, they dismay&rsquo;d, and dislodg&rsquo;d in the Night very
silently, marching towards <i>Batangas</i>, where their other Body was.
However their Departure could not be conceal&rsquo;d from the Vigilany
of our Men, who march&rsquo;d after them, <i>Martin de Herrera</i>,
Captain of the Governours Guard, leading the Van, which consisted of
<i>Spaniards</i>, and the bravest of the Natives. He overtook the
Enemy, and began to fall so hard upon their Rear, that they were
<span class="marginnote"><i>He cuts off one entire Body of
them.</i></span>forc&rsquo;d to face about; and after killing above 800
of them as they pass&rsquo;d a narrow but deep River, our main Body
coming up attack&rsquo;d the rest three several Ways, on an Eminency
they had taken, and slew above 1000 more; those that escap&rsquo;d
perishing the next Day, so that only one was taken alive, tho&rsquo;
the Governour would have had many sav&rsquo;d to serve in the Galleys;
but the <i>Japoneses</i> and Natives are so bloody, that neither his
Orders, nor Major <i>Azcueta</i>&rsquo;s Severity, or the other
Commanders could curb them.</p>
<p>The Men rested that Day, having travel&rsquo;d above five Leagues
over Grounds full of Sedges, and Bogs; and prepar&rsquo;d to proceed to
<i>Batangas</i>, to fight the other Body of Rebels, carrying some
Fields Pieces. The Major had dismiss&rsquo;d the <i>Japoneses</i>,
because they, alledging they were not Soldiers in Pay, would return to
<i>Manila</i>. He had only 50 Soldiers left with him, and found the
Enemy well fortify&rsquo;d, and furnish&rsquo;d with Provisions, as
having been Masters of the Country. He spoke to them in peaceable
Manner, as he had <span class="marginnote"><i>Offers those at</i>
Batangas <i>Terms.</i></span> done before to the other Party, offering
good Terms, if they would submit to the Governour; but Obstinacy had
stopp&rsquo;d their Ears, and excluded all Hopes, so that they would
not admit of any Accommodation. Our Men drew near, three several Ways
with their small Shot, and the <i>Pampangua Indians</i>, who were
brave, supported by the <i>Spaniards</i>, who led and encourag&rsquo;d
them, attack&rsquo;d the Fort; but the Defendants behav&rsquo;d
themselves so bravely, that they caus&rsquo;d them to retire, with the
Loss of four or five <i>Pampanguos</i> kill&rsquo;d, and some wounded.
Our Men came on again, and the Captain of the Guards, who Commanded
that Attack, with the Men under his Charge, and others that
joyn&rsquo;d him, fell on with such Fury, that they enter&rsquo;d
<span class="marginnote"><i>Destroys them all.</i></span> the Fort, and
put them to the Sword. About 600 escap&rsquo;d of whom they made an End
a few Days after. Some few above a Hundred were saved, who were
carry&rsquo;d alive to serve in the Galleys. Of our Men eight
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name=
"pb226">226</a>]</span>Natives and six <i>Japoneses</i> were
kill&rsquo;d in those two Actions; but never a <i>Spaniard</i>,
tho&rsquo; many were wounded, and among them the Captain of the Guards,
who had both his Thighs run through across with a Lance.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Encan</i> and others Executed.</span> On
the 22d <i>Encan</i>, otherwise call&rsquo;d <i>Baptist</i>, was
executed, being hang&rsquo;d and quarter&rsquo;d, his Head set up in
the <i>Parian</i>, and his Goods confiscated. The following Days the
like Justice was executed on other guilty <i>Chineses</i>; and had the
Laws of their own Country been observ&rsquo;d, the same Punishment had
been inflicted on their whole Families and Kindred.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>End of the</i> Chinese
<i>Rebellion.</i></span> Thus was that Conflagration suppress&rsquo;d,
which threatned the utter Ruin of the <i>Philippine</i> Islands, and
thus above 23000 <i>Chineses</i> perish&rsquo;d, few above 500 being
left for the Galleys, and all those Isles being restor&rsquo;d to
unexpected Peace. Some affirm, the Number of the <i>Sangleyes</i> slain
was greater, but that the Magistrates conceal&rsquo;d it, for fear
Notice should be taken of their Fault in admitting so many to live in
the Country, contrary to the King&rsquo;s Prohibition; yet in vain does
Subtilty contend with Truth.</p>
<p><i>Don Pedro</i> had receiv&rsquo;d some Intelligence of his
Majesties approving of the Enterprize on the <i>Moluccos</i>; and
whilst he expected to see the Effect of that Resolution, writ all the
Ways he could; as also through <i>India</i>, to solicite those who were
commission&rsquo;d in that Affair. Being deliver&rsquo;d of the Trouble
of the <i>Sangleyes</i>, he bent his Mind to provide all Necessaries
for the Fleet, against he should be commanded to set out; but the End
of this <span class="marginnote"><i>Ill Effects of the</i> Chinese
<i>Rebellion.</i></span> War, was the Beginning of other Difficulties
at <i>Manila</i>. All Handicrafts ceas&rsquo;d, Works were lay&rsquo;d
aside, and Provisions grew scarce; which Scarcity made all Things dear;
whereas before there was Abundance, all Things laborious being done by
the <i>Sangleyes</i>, by Reason that the Native <i>Indians</i> are
neither willing, nor industrious at such Affairs. They had quite laid
aside tilling the Land; breeding of Fowl, and weaving of Blankets, all
which they formerly us&rsquo;d to do, in the Time of their Infidelity.
The <i>Parian</i> or <i>Chinese</i> Quarter was particularly
ruin&rsquo;d with Fire and Sword. That Place us&rsquo;d to be so
plentiful and advantageous, that when <i>Don Pedro</i> came first to
<i>Manila</i>, he writ concerning it to a Kinsman of his in
<i>Spain</i>, as follows. <span class="marginnote"><i>Wealth of the</i>
Parian.</span> <i>This City is remarkeable for stately Buildings, which
have astonish&rsquo;d me. I shall only mention one Particular, which is
the chiefest, That it has a Suburb, or Quarter, full of all Sorts of
Silks, and Gold, and Mechanick Trades, and 400 Shops full of this Sort,
with above 8000 Men generally dealing in them; and at the Time when
Fleets come from China with Merchandize, which is at this Season there
are always above 13 or 14000 Men. They bring extraordinary Things, such
as are not in</i> Europe. <i>Don Pedro</i> was also afraid that the
Slaughter lately made would obstruct the Trade, and that the Ships
would not come as usual, with Provisions, from <i>China</i>. But the
greater and more general Apprehension was that instead of Merchants,
Ships of War would come to revenge the <i>Sangleyes</i>. He therefore
sent away <i>F. James <span class="marginnote">F. Guevara <i>sent
through</i> India <i>to</i> Spain.</span> de Guevara</i>, Prior of
<i>Manila</i>, into <i>Spain</i>, by the Way of <i>India</i>, with an
Account of what had been done, and of his Fears. The many Accidents
that befell him in <i>India</i>, <i>Persia</i>, <i>Turkey</i>, and
<i>Italy</i>, made him spend three Years before he came to Court, where
he then found other fresher Intelligence.</p>
<p>At the same Time <i>Don Pedro</i> sent Captain <i>Mark de la
Cueva</i>, with <i>F. Lewis Gandullo</i>, a <i>Dominican</i>, to
<i>Macao</i>, a City in <i>China</i>, where the <i>Portugueses</i>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name=
"pb227">227</a>]</span>reside, with Letters for the Commander in Chief
and Council of that City, giving them an Account of the Rebellion of
the <i>Sangleyes</i>, and the Event of it, that they, upon any Rumour
of a Fleet providing in <i>China</i>, might <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Message to</i> China.</span> send him Notice of it
several Ways. They had also Letters for the <i>Tutones</i>, or
<i>Tsuntos</i>, <i>Abytaos</i>, and Visitors of the Provinces of
<i>Canton</i>, and <i>Chincheo</i>, acquainting them with the Guilt of
the <i>Chineses</i>, which oblig&rsquo;d the <i>Spaniards</i> to punish
them so severely. The Messengers at their Arrival, found all the
Country peaceably dispos&rsquo;d, notwithstanding that some Sangleyes
flying from <i>Manila</i> in <i>Champanes</i>, had given an Account of
their Commotions. The Coming of these <i>Spaniards</i> to <i>Macao</i>
was soon known at <i>Chincheo</i>, and presently some of the richest
Captains, who us&rsquo;d <i>Manila</i> most, came to visit them; their
Names were <i>Guansan</i>, <i>Sinu</i>, and <i>Guachuan</i>. They being
fully inform&rsquo;d of the Truth of the Fact, took upon them to
deliver the Letters <i>Don Pedro</i> sent to the <i>Mandarines</i>, who
receiv&rsquo;d them by their Means. The Merchants of <i>Chincheo</i>
took Courage to trade in the <i>Philippine</i> Islands, and
sail&rsquo;d in their own Ships from <i>Macao</i>, with our Messengers,
carrying Abundance of Powder, Saltpeter, and Lead, <span class="corr"
id="xd21e26879" title="Source: werewith">wherewith</span> the
<span class="marginnote">Chineses <i>trade again at</i> Manila.</span>
publick <i>Magazines</i> were stor&rsquo;d. In <i>May</i> following 13
<i>Chinese</i> Ships arriv&rsquo;d at <i>Manila</i>, and many more
after them, continuing that Trade.</p>
<p><i>Don Pedro</i> sent the Ships that had brought Supplies from the
Islands, to <span class="marginnote">Spanish <i>Ship lost</i>.</span>
<i>New Spain</i>; the Commodore of them was cast away, and not a Man
nor a Plank sav&rsquo;d. He ceas&rsquo;d not at the same Time to store
the City with Provisions and Ammunition, that he might be at Leasure to
undertake the Expedition against the <i>Moluccos</i>. Now arriv&rsquo;d
Colonel <i>John de Esquivel</i>, <span class="marginnote">Esquivel
<i>with 600 Men at</i> Manila <i>from</i> New Spain.</span> from
<i>Mexico</i>, with 600 Soldiers, and Intelligence that farther
Provision was making in <i>New Spain</i> of Men, Stores, Ammunition,
and Money, by the King&rsquo;s Order. All came in due Season to
<i>Manila</i>; and there at that Time dy&rsquo;d the Arch-Bishop <i>Don
Miguel de Benavides</i>, generally lamented by all the Country. The
<i>Chinese</i> Ships that came again to trade, brought the Governour
the Answers to his Letters, contain&rsquo;d in three others, all to the
same Effect, from the <i>Tuton</i>, or <i>Tsunto</i>, that is, the
Viceroy, the <i>Hayton</i>, and the Visitor General of the Province of
<i>Chincheo</i>. Being translated by the Interpreters, they were found
to this Effect.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Chinese</i> Letter to the
Governour.</span> To the Chief Commander of <i>Luzon</i>. <i>Having
understood that the</i> Chineses <i>that went to Trade and Trafick in
the Kingdom of</i> Luzon<i>, have been kill&rsquo;d by the</i>
Spaniards<i>, I have inquir&rsquo;d into the Cause of that Slaughter,
and intreated the King to do Justice, on those who had been the
Occasion of so much Mischief, that the like may be prevented for the
future, and the Merchants enjoy Peace and Quietness. Some years since,
before I came hither as Visitor, a</i> Sangley<i>, whose Name was</i>
Tioneg<i>, went over to</i> Cabit<i>, in</i> Luzon<i>, with three</i>
Mandarines<i>, and the King&rsquo;s Leave, to seek for Gold and Silver,
which was all a Cheat; for he found neither Gold nor Silver, and
therefore I beseech&rsquo;d the King to punish that Deceiver,</i>
Tioneg<i>, that the</i> <span class="marginnote"><i>Discovery of the
Cheat of the three</i> Mandarines <i>above.</i></span> <i>World might
see how impartially Justice is administer&rsquo;d in</i> China. <i>It
was in the Time of the late Viceroy, and Eunuch, that</i> Tioneg <i>and
his Companion, whose Name was</i> Yanlion<i>, told the said Lye. Since
then I intreated the King to cause all the Papers relating to</i>
Tioneg<i>&rsquo;s Case, to be copy&rsquo;d, and the said</i> Tioneg<i>,
and the Proceedings against him, to be lay&rsquo;d before his Majesty,
and I my self saw those Papers, and was sensible that all the said</i>
Tioneg <i>had said <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228"
name="pb228">228</a>]</span>was a Lie. I writ to acquaint the King that
the</i> Castillas <i>suspected we intended</i> <span class=
"marginnote">Chineses <i>punish&rsquo;d for Falshood.</i></span> <i>to
make War on them, on Account of the Lyes</i> Tioneg <i>had told, and
therefore they had slain above 30000</i> Chineses <i>at</i> Luzon.
<i>The King did what I desir&rsquo;d, and accordingly punish&rsquo;d
the aforesaid</i> Yanlion, <i>ordering him to be put to Death; and
caus&rsquo;d</i> Tioneg&rsquo;<i>s Head to be cut off, and hung up in a
Cage. The</i> Chineses <i>that Dy&rsquo;d at</i> Luzon <i>were not to
blame, and I, and some others have acquainted the King with so much; as
also with the coming of two</i> English <i>Ships upon these Coasts
of</i> Chincheo, <i>a Thing very dangerous for</i> China, <i>that the
King may resolve what is to be done in two Affairs of such Consequence.
We also Writ to the King, to order two</i> Sangleyes <i>to be
punish&rsquo;d, for having shown the Harbour to the</i> English. <i>And
after having Writ as aforesaid to the King, he answer&rsquo;d, What did
the</i> English <i>Ships come into</i> China <i>for? Whether they came
to Rob? That they should be order&rsquo;d to depart thence immediately
to</i> Luzon; <i>and to tell those of</i> Luzon <i>that they should not
give Credit to the wicked and lying Persons among the</i> Chineses;
<i>and that they should immediately kill the two</i> Sangleyes. <i>As
for the rest we writ to him about, he answer&rsquo;d that we should do
our Wills. The Viceroy, the Eunuch and I, after receiving this Order,
do now send these our letters to the Governour of</i> Luzon, <i>that
his Lordship may be acquainted with the Grandeur of the King of</i>
China; <i>for he is so Great that he governs all the Sun and Moon shine
on; as also that the Governour of</i> Luzon <i>may know how well this
so large Kingdom is govern&rsquo;d,</i> <span class=
"marginnote">Japoneses <i>expell&rsquo;d</i> Corea.</span> <i>whose
King none has dar&rsquo;d to offend this long Time. And tho&rsquo;
the</i> Japoneses <i>have attempted to disturb</i> Corea, <i>which
belongs to the Government of</i> China, <i>that have not succeeded; but
have been expell&rsquo;d thence, and</i> Corea <i>has remain&rsquo;d
very peaceable and quiet, as is well known by Fame to the People of</i>
Luzon.</p>
<p><i>The last Year, when we were inform&rsquo;d, that so many</i>
Chineses <i>were slain at</i> Luzon, <i>on the Account of</i>
Tioneg&rsquo;<i>s falshood, we met many</i> Mandarines <i>of us to
agree to propose to the King, that he would revenge so great a</i>
<span class="marginnote">Spaniards <i>charg&rsquo;d with the Slaughter
of the</i> Chineses.</span> <i>Slaughter. We said, that the Land of</i>
Luzon <i>is poor, of no Value, and that formerly it was the Habitation
of none but Devils and Snakes; and that so many</i> Sangleyes <i>having
of late Years gone to Trade with the</i> Castillas, <i>they are now
grown so great; the said</i> Sangleyes <i>having labour&rsquo;d so much
there, building Walls, and Houses, making Gardens, and other Things
very Advantageous to the</i> Castillas. <i>And since this is so, why
had not the</i> Castillas <i>consider&rsquo;d these Things, nor been
grateful for these good Turns, but on the contrary so cruelly
destroy&rsquo;d so many Men? And tho&rsquo; we, two or three Times,
Writ to the King as above, he being Angry for the aforesaid Things,
answer&rsquo;d us, That it was not convenient to take Revenge, nor make
War on the People of</i> Luzon, <i>for three Reasons</i>. First,
<i>Because the</i> Castillas <i>have for many Years past, been Friends
to the</i> Chineses. Secondly, <i>Because it could not be known,
whether the Victory would fall to the</i> Castillas, <i>or the</i>
Chineses. Thirdly, <i>and lastly, Because the People kill&rsquo;d by
the</i> Castillas <i>were base, and ungrateful to their Native Country
of</i> China, <i>their Parents and Kindred, since they had not
return&rsquo;d to</i> China <i>in so many years; which People the King
said he did not much value, for the aforesaid Reasons; and he only
order&rsquo;d the Viceroy, the Eunuch, and me to Write this Letter by
the Embassador; that the People of</i> Luzon <i>may know the King
of</i> China <i>has a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href=
"#pb229" name="pb229">229</a>]</span>great Soul is very Patient and
Merciful, since he has not order&rsquo;d War to be made on the
Inhabitants of</i> Luzon. <i>And his Justice will appear, by his
causing the Falshood of</i> Tioneg <i>to be punish&rsquo;d. And since
the</i> Spaniards <i>are a discreet People, how can they not be
troubled for having kill&rsquo;d so many Men; and repent of it, and be
kind to the</i> Chineses <i>that are left. For if the</i> Castillas
<i>bear the</i> Chineses <i>good Will, and restore the</i> Sangleyes
<i>that have remain&rsquo;d of the War, and pay the Money that is due,
and restore the Goods taken from the</i> Sangleyes, <i>there will be
Amity betwixt this Kingdom, and that, and Trading Ships shall go every
Year; otherwise the King will not give Leave for any Ships to trade;
but on the contrary will cause 1000 Ships of</i> <span class=
"marginnote">Mandarines <i>Threats.</i></span> <i>War to be built, with
Soldiers, and Kindred of the slain, and with other Nations, and
Kingdoms that pay Homage to</i> China, <i>and will make war without
sparing any Person, and then the Kingdom of</i> Luzon <i>shall be given
to those People that pay Acknowledgement to</i> China. The Visitor
General&rsquo;s Letter was writ on the 12th of the second Month, which,
according to our Reckning, is <i>March</i>; the Eunuchs on the 16th,
and the Viceroys on the 22d of the same Month and Year.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Governours Answer, to the</i>
Mandarines.</span> The Governour return&rsquo;d an Answer to these
Letters by the same Messengers, in Terms full of Civility, and
Authority. He gave an Account of the Rebellion of the <i>Sangleyes</i>
from its first Rise; justifying the <i>Spaniards</i> for their natural
Defence, and the Punishment they had inflicted on the Criminals. He
tells them, no State can subsist without punishing the Wicked, or
rewarding the Good; and therefore he does not repent that Execution,
because it was to suppress those that would have destroy&rsquo;d us.
That the Visitor ought to consider what he would do, in Case the like
had happen&rsquo;d to him in <i>China</i>. That the only Thing which
troubled him was, that he could not save some <i>Sangley</i> Merchants
<i>Anhayes</i>, who dy&rsquo;d among the guilty; but that it was not
possible to prevent it, because the severity of War will not allow the
killing of some, and exempting of others; especially, they not being
known by the Soldiers in the Heat of Action. That using Mercy towards
those that were taken alive, he condemn&rsquo;d them to row in the
Galleys, the Punishment substituted among the <i>Castillas</i> for such
as deserve Death. Yet if it should be thought in <i>China</i> that it
ought to be moderated, they shall be set at Liberty. But let it be
consider&rsquo;d, said <i>Don Pedro</i>, that the not punishing of so
heinous an Offence, may be the Occasion of their falling into it again,
which would exclude all Mercy. The Goods of the <i>Chineses</i> that
were kill&rsquo;d are safe laid up, and to show I had no other Motive,
but the Execution of Justice, I will order them to be immediately
deliver&rsquo;d to their Heirs, or to such Persons, as they of Right
belong to. Nothing but Justice inclines me to any of these Things. Your
saying, that unless I release the Prisoners, there will be Leave
granted in <i>China</i> to the Kindred of the slain in the Rebellion,
to come in Arms to <i>Manila</i>, does not move me in the least;
because I take the <i>Chineses</i> to be so wise, that they will not go
upon such Undertakings upon a slight Occasion; especially, when no
Provocation has been given them on our Side. And in Case they should be
of another Mind there, we <i>Spaniards</i> are Men that know how to
defend our Right, our Religion, and our Territories. Let not the
<i>Chineses</i> think they are Lords of the World, as they pretend; for
we <i>Castillas</i>, who have measur&rsquo;d every Foot of it, very
well know the Lands of the <i>Chineses</i>; and therefore <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name="pb230">230</a>]</span>they
ought to understand, that the King of <i>Spain</i> maintains Wars with
Kings as powerful as theirs, and checks, and gives them much Trouble.
Nor is it any Thing new with us, when our Enemies think they have
brought us under, to be wasting and destroying their Lands, and never
give over till we have cast them out of their Thrones, and wrested
their Scepters out of their Hands. I should be very sorry the Commerce
should be interrupted; but at the same Time, believe the
<i>Chineses</i> are not willing to lose it, since it is so advantageous
to them, for they carry Home our Silver, which never wastes, in
Exchange for their Commodities, which are slight Things, soon
spoil&rsquo;d. It was discreetly done, not to admit the <i>English</i>
Ships that appear&rsquo;d upon the Coast, for they are not
<i>Spaniards</i>, but their Enemies, and Pyrates; for which Reason they
should have been punish&rsquo;d, had they come to <i>Manila</i>. To
conclude, for as much as we <i>Spaniards</i> always justify our
Proceedings, and value our selves upon the Worlds not being able to
say, we Usurp the Right of others, or make War on our Friends, what is
here promis&rsquo;d shall be perform&rsquo;d. And the <i>Chineses</i>
may take Notice, for the future, that we never do any Thing out of
Fear, or on Account of our Enemies Threats. <i>Don Pedro</i> concludes,
offering the Continuation of Friendship, upon new Assurances of Peace,
with the Kingdom of <i>China</i>; saying, he would, at the proper Time,
give Liberty to their Prisoners he had in the Galleys; Tho&rsquo; he
design&rsquo;d first to make Use of them, and did so in his Expedition
to the <i>Moluccos</i>, which he was then preparing for; and all this
was punctually perform&rsquo;d.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Emperour of</i> Japan&rsquo;s
<i>Letter.</i></span> He receiv&rsquo;d other Letters at the same Time,
from the Emperor of <i>Japan</i>, wherein, after returning him Thanks
for a Present of Wine of Grapes, which <i>Don Pedro</i> had sent him,
with other Things of Value, he Encourag&rsquo;d him to Trade, and
desir&rsquo;d he would not send him any Christian Preachers, without
his Consent. For, says he, this Country is call&rsquo;d <i>Xincoco</i>,
which signifies, <i>Dedicated to Idols</i>; which have been
honour&rsquo;d with much Commendation by our Fore-Fathers, whose
Actions I alone can not reverse, and therefore it is not convenient
that your Law be spread abroad, or preach&rsquo;d in <i>Japan</i>; and
if your Lordship is willing to entertain Amity with me, and these
Kingdoms, do as I would have you. So says the <i>Japonese</i>. <i>Don
Pedro</i> answer&rsquo;d and appeas&rsquo;d him, so that the preaching
was continu&rsquo;d in his Dominions.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Dutch <i>Squadron.</i></span> This same
Year 1604, the Provinces of <i>Holland</i> and <i>Zealand</i>,
according to their Custom, fitted out a Squadron of twelve tall Ships,
well equipp&rsquo;d, with some smaller Vessels, and, as if they had
been Lords of the Winds and of the Seas, set Sail for <i>India</i>, the
known Way, arriving prosperously, in a short Time, at the Cape of
<i>Good Hope</i>. All the Captains had been there before, and the
Pilots valu&rsquo;d themselves upon no less Experience. The Admiral was
<i>Stephen Drage</i>. Beginning to visit their Forts, and Factories, in
Order to take some Prizes, as well as Trade, they met with two small
Ships, loaden with Ivory, at the Bar of <i>Mozambique</i>. They
chas&rsquo;d them, and tho&rsquo; <span class="marginnote"><i>Takes
two</i> Portugues <i>Ships.</i></span> they fled amain, being
pursu&rsquo;d with no less Swiftness, the <i>Dutch</i> Robbers
overtook, and after a sharp Engagement enter&rsquo;d them. They burnt
the one, and mann&rsquo;d the other, which was a Reinforcement to
prosecute their Robberies. All those Kings, and the Commanders of our
Forts, receiv&rsquo;d them as Friends. In <i>September</i>, they came
to the Bar of <i>Goa</i>; and lay 15 Days at <i>Bardes</i>, in as much
Security as if they had been at <i>Amsterdam</i>, expecting
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=
"pb231">231</a>]</span>the <i>India</i> Ships. Thence they sent away a
Ship to <i>Cambaya</i>, to exchange the Ivory they had not long before
robb&rsquo;d our People of, acting not like Pyrates, but Merchants who
dispose of the Wealth they pick up by Trade, and succeeded prosperously
in all their Undertakings. They sent two more Ships to <i>Bengula</i>,
with other Commodities; all which return&rsquo;d in due Time
considerably enrich&rsquo;d. Perceiving that no Power oppos&rsquo;d
them, they sailed <span class="marginnote"><i>And a Foist.</i></span>
down the Coast of <i>Malabar</i>, trading wheresoever they thought fit,
and took another <i>Portuguese</i> Vessel, called a <i>Foist</i>, which
had 21 Oars; and after unlading the Booty, they lifted her up their
Way, and took her along with them.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Zamori <i>signifies</i> C&aelig;sar.</span>
After this they bent their Thoughts upon greater Matters, to which End
they sent an Embassy to the <i>Zamori</i>, which Name imports as much
as C&aelig;sar among us, and he is King of <i>Calicut</i>, a Friend and
Confederate with the <i>Dutch</i>. Having agreed upon an Interview,
they fell to Trade, and whilst the rest attended Commerce, and private
Gain, the Admiral consulted about State Affairs, concerting to carry on
the War against the <i>Spaniards</i>, and more particularly the
<i>Portugueses</i>. They settled the Time, and the Forces they were to
joyn for that Effect. Then they diverted themselves with Feasting
<span class="marginnote"><i>Joins with the</i> Dutch.</span> and
Treats. At one of which, by way of Farewel, <i>Zamori</i> gave Admiral
<i>Drage</i> an Emeraud, thought to be the largest and beautifullest in
the World. They went on, and took some Prizes on the Coast of
<i>Java</i>, and among them a small Ship, in which were <i>Don Manuel
de Melo</i>, Commander in Chief of the <i>Moluccos</i>, and his Wife,
who was oblig&rsquo;d to fight as well as her Husband, and yet they
could not escape Captivity. The nearer they drew to <i>Ternate</i>, the
more considerable Encounters they had, for in <span class=
"marginnote"><i>They take a</i> Portuguese <i>Frigat at</i>
Amboyna.</span> Sight of <i>Amboyna</i> they fell in with a Frigat
coming from the <i>Moluccos</i> to Anchor in that Island, which they
took, and in her Captain <i>Antony Machado</i>, her Commander. They
stay&rsquo;d at <i>Amboyna</i>, hoping to recover what they had lost,
either by Treachery, or Force. The Year 1605 had now commenced, and
they began their Work on the 23rd of <i>February</i>.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Drage <i>takes</i> Amboyna.</span> Eight
Ships and six Tenders enter&rsquo;d the Port, and the Fort was
surrender&rsquo;d to them without much Difficulty, or Opposition. They
also possess&rsquo;d themselves of the <i>Portuguese</i> Colony. Those
People seeing the <i>Dutch</i> so strong in Men and Cannon, durst not,
nor could they well oppose them. Forty <i>Portugueses</i> took an Oath
of Fidelity to the Prince of <i>Orange</i>&rsquo;s Bastard Son. They
put the Commander in Chief into Irons, and deliver&rsquo;d the Fort to
the <i>Dutch</i>, alledging, for an Excuse, that they had not
Ammunition to defend themselves. There was another greater Mischief,
which was, that the Natives favour&rsquo;d the <i>Dutch</i>, as their
Deliverers from the <i>Portuguese</i> Yoke; and they are well
belov&rsquo;d there, and in all Places where they Trade, because
<span class="marginnote"><i>Fits out</i> 40 Carcoas.</span> of late
they have taken this Course, not to meddle with their Religion, nor so
much as mention it, unless, where any will embrace Christianity on
their own Accord. They neither wrong&rsquo;d nor distur&rsquo;d any
Body; and to show they would always maintain them in that Security,
within five Days, they fitted out 40 <i>Carcoas</i>, to defend the
Natives against any Enemy.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Indians <i>well affected to the</i>
Dutch.</span> The Admiral pick&rsquo;d out three of the Ships, and went
himself with them to the Islands of <i>Banda</i>, to load Nutmeg, Mace,
and Clove, there and at <i>Amboyna</i>. The Fame of this Success, and
the Hatred conceived against the <i>Spaniards</i>, were so favourable
to this Nation, that at this Time the People <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name="pb232">232</a>]</span>of
<i>Amboyna</i>, <i>Ito</i>, <i>Veranula</i>, and other Places, had
their Embassadors at <i>Sunda</i>, to expect this Fleet, which came
from Home at their Request. Before they set out from <i>Holland</i>
they had receiv&rsquo;d Embassadors from the King of <i>Achem</i> in
<i>Sumatra</i>, to the same End. For this Reason the <i>Dutch</i> give
out, that they come to revenge the Wrongs, the <i>Portugueses</i> and
<i>Spaniards</i> have done to the Natives, and to restore them to their
Liberty. The Designs of these perfidious People were no longer a
Secret; for the Admiral <i>Drage</i> refitted five of his Ships, and
sent them to the <i>Moluccos</i>, to take the Fort and Kingdom of
<i>Tydore</i>, the only one that continu&rsquo;d in Subjection to
<i>Spain</i>; and it was publickly reported, that the King of
<i>Ternate</i> would forward the Enterprize with his Ships and Men. The
<i>Dutch</i> Vice-Admiral sail&rsquo;d with these Ships stopping by the
Way to make his Advantage, take in the Refreshments in their Factories,
and lade Pepper, and other Spice. Every Thing <span class=
"marginnote"><i>The</i> Dutch <i>prosperous</i><span class="corr" id=
"xd21e27632" title="Not in source">.</span></span> succeeded as they
could with, tho&rsquo; they aspir&rsquo;d to some Matters which
requir&rsquo;d a greater Power than they brought. They intended to pass
by the Streight of <i>Acapulco</i>, and there to lie in wait for the
Ships belonging to the <i>Philippines</i> going and coming, because
they knew them to be Rich, and might take them. To this End they
delay&rsquo;d Time, till they could be joyn&rsquo;d by the two Ships
they expected from <i>Sunda</i>, laden with Pepper, from that
plentiful, and secure Factory of theirs.</p>
<p>Aboard the eight Ships there was great Store of Bricks, Lime, and
squared Stones, Wheele-Barrows, and other Tooles and Materials for
Building; <span class="marginnote"><i>Materials for Building in the</i>
Dutch <i>Ships.</i></span> all which was to be carry&rsquo;d from the
aforesaid Streight, tho&rsquo; they had already began to build it at
<i>Amboyna</i>, and landing a considerable Part of those Materials,
they left there 130 Soldiers, to carry on the Works, and Garrison the
Fort. At the Heels of this Fleet they expected another to lay Siege to
<i>Malaca</i>; designing from thence to Govern <i>India</i>, as the
<i>Portugueses</i> have <span class="marginnote"><i>Their Design
against</i> Malaca.</span> done. In Order to this, they had before
confederated with the Kings of <i>Jor</i>, <i>Achem</i>, and
<i>Sunda</i>, with whose Assistance, and that of other Native
<i>Sangiacks</i>, they were to overthrow the Power of <i>Portugal</i>;
for they were resolv&rsquo;d not to quit <i>India</i>, and since its
Commodities enrich&rsquo;d them, they would pay for the Expence of the
War; besides, that they were already so wealthy, that even in
<i>Flanders</i> the Soldiers deserted from the Arch-Duke
<i>Albertus</i>, to serve them. Notwithstanding this extraordinary
Affection, <span class="marginnote"><i>The</i> English <i>give the</i>
Spaniards <i>Intelligence.</i></span> wherewith the <i>Dutch</i> are
entertain&rsquo;d in all those Countries, before they came to
<i>Amboyna</i>, two <i>English</i> Ships came to an Anchor near by, and
acquainted the Natives, that a <i>Dutch</i> Squadron was coming to
possess itself of the Island; but bid them not to fear, for it had none
but poor scoundrel Men; and therefore they should defend themselves,
offering them their Assistance, and acquainting them that the Crowns of
<i>Spain</i> and <i>England</i> were then in Amity; and therefore the
Subjects of them both ought to be so of Course. They slighting this
favourable Opportunity, chose rather to become <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Their just Dealing after the Peace.</i></span> Subjects
to Prince <i>Maurice</i>, and undergo the <i>Dutch</i> Yoke. The
<i>English</i> demanded Clove, and offer&rsquo;d them their own Price
for it, and were so just, that they never joyn&rsquo;d with the
<i>Dutch</i>. In short, <i>Amboyna</i> remain&rsquo;d in the Enemies
Hands. The People dispers&rsquo;d, many of them went to <i>Malaca</i>,
and among the rest, the Commander in chief, <i>Don Emanuel de Melo</i>,
with some <i>Portugueses</i>. Others repair&rsquo;d to the Island of
<i>Cebu</i>, part of the <i>Philippines</i> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name="pb233">233</a>]</span>and
other Places, for they had all their Liberty. They all departed
<i>Amboyna</i> about the middle of <i>May</i>, but without their Goods,
or Spice; being positively forbid that Trade, the <i>Dutch</i>
alledging it was all their own.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>They give Intelligence of the</i> Dutch
<i>at</i> Tydore.</span> One of those <i>English</i> Ships sailing
along those Coasts, and escaping the Ridges of Rocks, got before-hand
to the Port of <i>Tydore</i>. They call&rsquo;d the Commander in Chief
of the Fort, <i>Peter Alvarez Abreu</i>, and inform&rsquo;d him, that
they left the <i>Dutch</i> Squadron fortifying the strong Holds at
<i>Amboyna</i>; and that when they had reduc&rsquo;d all in those Seas,
they would come to fall upon <i>Tydore</i>. The Commander in Chief
return&rsquo;d Thanks for that friendly Intelligence; and among other
Civilities that pass&rsquo;d between them, desir&rsquo;d to know the
Motive that induc&rsquo;d them to show such Kindness. Then the
<i>English</i> told him, That their Kings were Friends, and to convince
him of it, and the Danger he was in, offer&rsquo;d him as much
Ammunition as he stood in need of. They gave him Six Barrels of Powder,
100 Cannon Balls, and a Number of Head-Pieces. This made the
<i>Tydores</i> and <i>Portugueses</i> begin to fortify themselves, and
was the Product of the late Peace.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Four</i> Dutch <i>Ships at</i>
Tydore.</span> A Month after, four great <i>Dutch</i> Ships, and four
Tenders, came to the Island, where two of the King&rsquo;s Galleons lay
at Anchor, with the <i>Portuguese</i> Ships laden with Goods and
Provisions. The <i>Dutch</i> Admiral sent the King of <i>Tydore</i>
Word, That if he would deliver him that Fort, and expell the
<i>Portugueses</i>, he would be his Friend; and desiring he would not
<span class="marginnote"><i>Their Message to the King.</i></span> start
any Difficulties, since he might easily do it, being a peaceable King
in his own Dominions; besides that, they had Men and Strength enough
aboard that Squadron, to force them to consent to what they now
courteously demanded. The King of <i>Tydore</i> sent him a Cow, and
answer&rsquo;d, <span class="marginnote"><i>His Answer.</i></span> That
he neither could, nor ought to put the <i>Portugueses</i> out of their
Forts, nor to admit of any other Nation in their Place, till they had
either voluntarily, or by Force of Arms, abandon&rsquo;d their
Possession. That whilst they <span class="marginnote"><i>Bravery of
the</i> Portuguese <i>Commander.</i></span> two decided the Quarrel, he
would look on as Neuter. The <i>Portuguese</i> Commander in Chief,
understanding what Messages pass&rsquo;d, interrupted them, sending to
let the <i>Dutch</i> Men know. That it was in vain to talk of
surrendring the Fort, whilst he was alive, and present. That he was to
treat with him, and the marry&rsquo;d Men that liv&rsquo;d in it about
that Affair.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Dutch <i>take two Galleons.</i></span>
Being come to this Resolution, the next Morning the <i>Dutch</i> Ships
remov&rsquo;d, and went to board the <i>Portugueses</i> that were at
<i>Tydore</i>, two Cannon Shot from the Fort. They fought above two
Hours, and so constant was Fortune to one Side, that in so short a
Time, the <i>Portugueses</i> that remain&rsquo;d alive were fain to
throw themselves into the Sea, and their Galleons <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Bold Answer of the</i> Portugueses.</span> were taken,
one of which they immediately burnt. The next Day another Message was
sent to <i>Tydore</i>, wherein the <i>Dutch</i> directed the King to
propose the surrendring of the Fort to the <i>Portugueses</i>, and he
would give them the Galleon he had spar&rsquo;d, to carry them and
their Effects, wheresoever they should think fit. The
<i>Portugueses</i> taking Courage, <span class="marginnote">Dutch
<i>and</i> Ternates <i>joyn and burn a Town.</i></span> where others
would be dismay&rsquo;d, answer&rsquo;d, That the Loss of the Galleons
had not daunted them; for they would rather dye all of them, than
deliver up the Fort. The <i>Dutch</i> durst not batter it alone, but
resolv&rsquo;d to joyn the King of <i>Ternate</i>, who was already set
out with abundance of <i>Carcoas</i> to that Effect. They met him a
League from the Fort, and spending little <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb234" href="#pb234" name="pb234">234</a>]</span>Time in Ceremonies
return&rsquo;d together, burning a Town of <i>Tydore</i> by the Way,
came the next Morning before the Fort.</p>
<p>They landed 800 <i>Dutch</i> and <i>Ternate</i> Soldiers, and having
made a Trench with Barrels fill&rsquo;d with Earth, batter&rsquo;d the
Fort for three Days from that Work, with two Pieces of Cannon. At the
same Time they play&rsquo;d upon it from their Ships, firing above 1500
Shot. The third Day they <span class="marginnote"><i>Batter the Fort
and are repuls&rsquo;d.</i></span> drew nearer; and the fourth in the
Morning began to batter more furiously. They kill&rsquo;d the Constable
of the Castle, and in the midst of the Confusion, the King of
<i>Ternate</i> and the <i>Dutch</i>, that were ashore, advanc&rsquo;d,
drawing the Cannon under the very Fort, having surpriz&rsquo;d the
<i>Portugueses</i>, and falling on them unexpectedly. They soon
recovering themselves, attack&rsquo;d the <i>Dutch</i> afresh, who
turning their Backs, behav&rsquo;d themselves so basely, that they ran
into the Water; abandoning the Guns they had ashore. In the Height of
this Success, many <i>Dutch</i> being slain, and only four
<i>Portugueses</i>, on a sudden they spy&rsquo;d all the Fort in a
Flame, which roar&rsquo;d from <span class="marginnote"><i>The Fort
Burnt.</i></span> the Ground to the Tops of the Houses, till a
considerable Part was blown up, and almost all the rest consum&rsquo;d,
and lay&rsquo;d flat. Six and twenty <i>Portugueses</i> were burnt, and
it could never be discover&rsquo;d or guess&rsquo;d, how, or which Way
the Powder was set a fire, to cause that mighty Destruction. The
<i>Portugueses</i>, who just before were joyful for their Victory,
having no Walls to shelter them, were forc&rsquo;d to retire to the
City of <i>Tydore</i>, and the <i>Dutch</i> and <i>Ternates</i>
rallying, pursu&rsquo;d them thither. The King receiv&rsquo;d them in
friendly Manner, and he himself went the same Day <span class=
"marginnote">Tydore <i>taken by the</i> Dutch.</span> aboard the
<i>Dutch</i> Ship that lay at Anchor before it, and calling the
<i>Dutch</i> Admiral, propos&rsquo;d to him the Affair of the Fort, and
that if those who defended it had ships allow&rsquo;d them, they would
go away to other Parts. He agreed to it, and though it cost the
<i>Portugueses</i> all they had, they accepted of three small Tenders,
a Galliot that had been the King&rsquo;s, and a <i>Dutch</i> Tender to
secure them against the <i>Ternates</i>. The <i>Dutch</i> settled Amity
with the King of <i>Tydore</i>; that they should continue in his
Dominions; and erect Factories, and Trade for <i>Clove</i>, as the
<i>Portugueses</i> had done. Thus the Conquer&rsquo;d having bought
some Ships dispers&rsquo;d themselves about those Islands. Many of them
went to the <i>Philippines</i>, where <i>Don Pedro</i>, the Governour,
examin&rsquo;d them, in order to get Information concerning the
<i>Moluccos</i>.</p>
<p><i>Antony de Silva</i>, a <i>Portuguese</i>, was one of them that
escap&rsquo;d from the <span class="marginnote">Dutch <i>design to take
the Ships of the</i> Philippines.</span> Fort of <i>Ternate</i>, and
came to the Town of <i>Arevalo</i> in the <i>Philippines</i>; Besides
being a Soldier, he was also a <i>Naguatato</i>, or Interpreter. This
Man gave an Authentick Relation of that Affair, and added, That being
brought Prisoner from <i>Amboyna</i>, the <i>Dutch</i> Admiral having a
Sea-Chart before him, look&rsquo;d for <i>Mindoro</i>, <i>Manila</i>,
and for <i>Cabite</i>; and being ask&rsquo;d by <i>Silva</i>, why he
look&rsquo;d for it, was inform&rsquo;d, That his Design was, in Case
he did not succeed at the <i>Moluccos</i>, to try to take some of the
Ships that trade betwixt <i>New Spain</i>, and the <i>Philippines</i>.
<i>Silva</i> reply&rsquo;d, That <span class="marginnote">Silva
<i>gives Intelligence of it.</i></span> he had not the Time to meet
either; because those that come to the <i>Philippines</i> arrive about
the 10th of <i>May</i>, and the others set out on the 10th of
<i>June</i>. However that was the Design of the <i>Dutch</i> Admiral,
who intended to get Intelligence at <i>Mindoro</i>, thence to sail to
<i>Macao</i>, send an Embassador into <i>China</i>, and revenge the
Wrong <i>Don Pablos de Portugal</i> had done <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235" name="pb235">235</a>]</span>them
in those Countries. Then to load Pepper at <i>Patane</i>; next at the
Streight of <i>Sincapura</i>, to endeavour to take the <i>Chinese</i>
Ships that resort to <i>Malaca</i>; and whatever happen&rsquo;d, to
hold on his Voyage to <i>Holland</i> that Way, loaden with Treasure.
All this the <i>Dutch</i> Admiral communicated to Antony de Silva, as
to one that was to go with him into <i>Holland</i>, because he was a
Soldier, and able Interpreter in both Languages; and therefore
<i>Stephen Drage</i> made much of him. This Intelligence was
confirm&rsquo;d <span class="marginnote"><i>All the</i> Moluccos
<i>lost to</i> Spain.</span> by some others, who had fought and
escap&rsquo;d the Slaughter at <i>Tydore</i>. <i>Don Pedro</i> hearing
so much, was concern&rsquo;d, as a Man zealous for the Church, and for
his King; and it griev&rsquo;d him to consider, that the Crown of
<i>Spain</i> had not a Foot of Land left it in the <i>Moluccos</i>; and
that a Rebel was in quiet Possession of them all.</p>
<p>Prosperity having embolden&rsquo;d, and strengthen&rsquo;d the
<i>Dutch</i>, <i>Don Pedro</i> <span class="marginnote">Don
Pedro&rsquo;<i>s Precautions.</i></span> assembling his Council of War,
order&rsquo;d that the Captains <i>Antony Freyle</i>, Commander of the
Squadron belonging to the <i>Pintados</i>, <i>Peter Sevil</i>,
<i>Stephen de Alcazar</i>, and <i>Bernardine Alfonso</i>, should repair
to the Forts of the <i>Pintados</i>, and other Islands that were in
Danger, with their Companies. He refitted the Ships, and prepar&rsquo;d
his Cannon, as being so near a victorious Enemy, who so successfully
put in Execution all their Threats. <i>Antony</i> <span class=
"marginnote">Dutch <i>Letters and Present to the King of</i>
Ternate.</span> <i>de Sylva</i> show&rsquo;d an Original Letter,
written by another <i>Dutch</i> Admiral at the Island of <i>Borneo</i>,
to the King of <i>Ternate</i>, and sent by <i>Philip Bissegop</i>,
Captain of a Ship, with a Present of a Quantity of fine <i>Holland</i>;
Six Bales of several Vessels with Musk; Twelve Bottles of Rose-Water;
Six Pounds of Dutch <i>Anfion</i>, that is, Opium, which, as has been
said, disturbs the Senses, and is us&rsquo;d by those People to
encourage them to fight; and six Barrels of Powder. He gave him an
Account of <i>Andrew Furtado</i>&rsquo;s unfortunate Voyage, the
Obstacles, Storms, and Enemies he had met with, since his Departure
from <i>Ternate</i>, till he came to <i>Malaca</i>. He gave him the
Title of Most Serene Prince, and Potent King of the <i>Moluccos</i>,
<i>Bandas</i>, <i>Amboyna</i>, and innumerable other Islands. He
congratulated with him for the Event of his Arrival at the
<i>Moluccos</i>; promising he would return to <i>Ternate</i> with a
greater Power, he expected from Holland, and take Possession of the
Forts, to extirpate the common Enemy, the King of <i>Spain</i>; and
encourag&rsquo;d him with these Hopes, to hold out till then. He
assur&rsquo;d him, that he should scour all those Seas from the
<i>Moluccos</i>, and extend his Dominions as far as <i>China</i>,
without being hinder&rsquo;d by the <i>Philippines</i> or
<i>Japoneses</i>. To this End, he desired him to renew his Friendship
with <i>Mindanao</i>, and to acquaint the King of those Islands, that
he was a Friend to the <i>Dutch</i>, so to give them Admittance to
those Ports, Freedom of Trade, and amicable Entertainment, as was
requisite for their Undertakings; this being a Thing most Expedient,
above all other Politick Considerations. He added, he might observe,
and be assur&rsquo;d, that nothing was so little regarded in
<i>Spain</i>, as to contrive that their many Provinces should preserve
some Sort of Union. That therefore all those which are very remote, and
subject to that Crown, ought to take much Notice of the great Delays
there, in coming to a Resolution, and sending Succours from
<i>Spain</i>; because before they believe, or examine the News brought
them in order to believe them, Affairs have taken a new Turn, and
consequently neither the <i>Spanish</i> Councils, nor their Arms come
seasonably. That Experience <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href=
"#pb236" name="pb236">236</a>]</span>had made most of these Things
known to his Highness, and his Zeal for his Service oblig&rsquo;d him
to mention them. <i>Antony de Silva</i>, added, that he was very sure
the King of <i>Ternate</i> had not omitted doing any Thing of what the
<i>Dutch</i> Man recommended to him; and that he had already
propos&rsquo;d to his People to go abroad to fight, far from their own
Islands. Tho&rsquo; it was never apprehended he would do so, yet at
that Time it much troubled <i>Don Pedro</i>, because he was so spent
with the Affair of the <i>Sangleyes</i>, the Want of whom he
labour&rsquo;d so to supply, that no such Mischief might happen again,
it being so necessary to support the Trade of the <i>Philippines</i>
another Way, and procure safety at Home in Order to make War, and keep
up a Reputation.</p>
<p>Time, which sometimes gives Hope, and sometimes Dispair, comforted
<i>Don Pedro</i> in his Affliction, bringing in a few Months after some
Ships of private Persons from <i>New Spain</i>, and then in due Season
the usual Fleet. <span class="marginnote"><i>Men, Money,</i> &amp;c.
<i>arrive at</i> Manila <i>from</i> New Spain.</span> They
arriv&rsquo;d at <i>Manila</i>, on the Eve of <i>S. Matthias</i>, and
in them the <i>Spaniards</i> sent from <i>Spain</i>, for the Expedition
of <i>Ternate</i>, with above 200 more from the Marquess <i>de
Montesclaros</i>, Viceroy of <i>New Spain</i>, as also the other
Necessaries, and Money, pursuant to the King&rsquo;s Order. Part of
this came committed to Brother <i>Gaspar Gomez</i>, who was
receiv&rsquo;d with incredible Joy. He deliver&rsquo;d all his Letters
to the Governour, and immediate Care was taken to quarter the Officers
and Soldiers, and to distribute them speedily, so that all Men might
believe there was no other Design in their coming, but the Security of
the <i>Philippine</i> Islands, threatned by the Emperor of
<i>Japan</i>, and the Conspiracies of the <i>Sangleyes</i>. This Report
was industriously so given out, that it might fly and spread abroad
<span class="marginnote"><i>Management of the Governour.</i></span>
without the Kingdom, lest they might receive any Intelligence, who had
cause to fear. Besides that, as the Fame of those great Preparations
was Advantageous to the <i>Spaniards</i> in Point of Reputation, so the
Reality of the Power they had, added to the Opinion conceiv&rsquo;d,
prov&rsquo;d the Defence and Security of them all. In <i>Japan</i>,
only the News that <i>Manila</i> was full of Men, and Ships of War,
allay&rsquo;d, or quite banish&rsquo;d the Disgust of that King, on
Account of <i>Don Pedro</i>&rsquo;s refusing him Ship-Wrights. The
People of <i>Chincheo</i> also forbore meditating Revenge against an
Enemy, whose Victories were back&rsquo;d with such Succours. <i>Don
Pedro</i> consider&rsquo;d all these Particulars, and each of them made
him conclude, that he might with Safety be absent for some Time from
<i>Manila</i>. However the King of <i>Ternate</i> overjoy&rsquo;d that
he had shaken off the <i>Spanish</i> Yoke, made little Account of all
that was told him, concerning its Neighbouring Kingdoms, believing they
would never recover their Ancient Possessions. The <i>Dutch</i>
Commanders, who were rebuilding the burnt Fort at <i>Tydore</i>, sent
him a considerable Number of Heavy Brass Cannon, of <i>Drakes</i>, and
Muskets, and he hired some of the Ingeniers, that came in those Ships,
to look to his Fortifications, and reside in them, and in his City.
Some accepted of the Habitation, approving of that disorderly, and
irreligious Liberty of Life allow&rsquo;d in that Country; where
considering the frequent Resort of Ships from the North, and the many
Factories, they reckon&rsquo;d themselves as good as at Home, since
they could often meet with their Kindred or Friends, or at least with
their Country-Men. Banish&rsquo;d <i>Spaniards</i> and
<i>Portugueses</i> arriv&rsquo;d daily at the Port of <i>Oton</i>, in
the <i>Philippine</i> Islands, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237"
href="#pb237" name="pb237">237</a>]</span>among them <i>Paul de
Lima</i>, a Person of great Experience, and still General of the
Artillery at <i>Tydore</i>, who, besides the News of the late
Destruction, brought an Account of the Joy wherewith the <i>Dutch</i>
dug up the Guns he endeavour&rsquo;d to hide, and how much they were
increased in Strength and Shipping. He was receiv&rsquo;d with much
Honour, in regard to his Quality, and because he was one of those who
had lost Lands and Goods, taken from him by the King of <i>Ternate</i>,
and his Information, and Counsel were of Use for what afterwards
happen&rsquo;d. All Men attended the Warlike Preparations, in their
several Stations, but with equal Zeal; building Ships, and gathering
Provisions, Arms, and Ammunitions; and <i>Don Pedro</i> himself was so
diligent and vigilant, that he attended the meanest Employments, giving
an Example, and encouraging; so that it may be said, he did every
Thing, for he ply&rsquo;d all Hands.</p>

<p><span class="marginnote">Yloilo <i>Port the Rendezvous of The
Navy.</i></span> <i>Don Pedro de Acunna</i>, now Captain General of the
Fleet that was assembled in the <i>Philippine</i> Islands, at the same
time took Care to see it fitted out with Expedition, and to provide for
the Security of the Province he was to forsake, that he might go upon
that so difficult Undertaking. Some there were, who look&rsquo;d upon
it as Part of <i>Don Pedro</i>&rsquo;s good Fortune, that the
<i>Molucco</i> Islands had been utterly lost, that since he had the
more Matter to work upon, his Victory might be the more glorious. He
most industriously provided all Things requisite for the Use of War;
and even for all the Accidents it might be liable to. The Point, or
Promontory of <i>Yloilo</i> runs out into the Sea, not far from
<i>Arevalo</i>, in the Island of <i>Panay</i>, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name=
"pb239">239</a>]</span>forming a Harbour proper and capacious enough to
be the Place of Arms, for the Preparations then in Hand. Here the Fleet
rendezvous&rsquo;d, consisting <span class="marginnote"><i>Particulars
of the Fleet.</i></span> of Six Tall Ships, Six Galleys, Three
Galliots, like those they call <i>Galizabras</i>, belonging to the
Crown of <i>Portugal</i>; in one of which was <i>Peter Alvarez de
Abreu</i>, Commander in Chief of the Fort of <i>Tydore</i>; the other
two, under the Command of <i>John Rodriguez Camelo</i>, Commodore, sent
from <i>Malaca</i>, by the General <i>Andrew Furtado de Mendoza</i>, to
be aiding with his Courage and Conduct, and to carry him an Account of
the Success. One flat bottom&rsquo;d Galliot, to land the Artillery,
and in it 300 Baskets of Rice. Four Foists built purposely for carrying
of Provisions. Two <i>Champanes</i> of Ten Tun Burden each, with 1600
Baskets of clean Rice. Two <i>Dutch</i> Long-Boats, which carry&rsquo;d
over the <i>Portugueses</i> when the Fort of <i>Tydore</i> was lost.
Seven Frigats belonging to the King, and Seven more to private Persons,
and the like Number of <i>Champanes</i>, in all 36 Sail.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Land Forces.</i></span> Colonel
<i>John de Esquivel</i> brought 12 Companies of <i>Spanish</i> Foot;
four whereof were rais&rsquo;d in <i>Andaluzia</i>, being his own, and
those of the Captains, <i>Paul Garrucho</i>, <i>Peter Sevil</i>, and
<i>Luke de Vergara Gaviria</i>. Six came from <i>New Spain</i>, under
the Captains <i>Don Roderick de Mendoza</i>, Son to <i>Don John de
Raeza y Castilla</i>, and to <i>Donna Maria de Mendoza</i>, and by her
Grandson to the Marquess <i>de Montesclaros</i>, and therefore, out of
Respect to his Kinsman, the Viceroy of <i>New Spain</i>, he came out of
<i>Italy</i> to serve his Majesty in the <i>Philippine</i> Islands; the
others were Captain <i>Pascual de Alarcon Pacheco</i>, <i>Martin de
Esquivel</i>, <i>Bernardine Alfonso</i>, <i>Peter Delgado</i>, and
<i>Stephen de Alcazar</i>. Two other Companies commanded by the
Captains <i>John Guerra de Cervantes</i>, and <i>Christopher de
Villagra</i>, belong&rsquo;d to the Forces of <i>Manila</i>, and the
Province of the <i>Pintados</i>. All which, with <span class=
"marginnote">1423 Spaniards.</span> their Officers, make up 1423
<i>Spaniards</i>. Under the Colonel <i>Don Guillermo</i>, and the
Captains <i>Don Francis Palaot</i>, <i>Don John Lit</i>, <i>Don
Lewis</i> and <i>Augustin Lout</i>, 344 <i>Pampangua</i>, and
<i>Tagalo</i> Indians; besides 620 others of the same Nations, for the
Sea and Land Service, and 649 Rowers. All the Men in the Fleet, besides
the General&rsquo;s Household and Family, amounted to 3095; with 75
Pieces of Cannon of all Sorts, and all other Perquisites for Sea,
Landing, Fight, and Battery.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Fleet sails from</i> Yloilo.</span>
<i>Don Pedro</i> sail&rsquo;d from the Port of <i>Yloilo</i>, with all
these Preparations, on the 15th of <i>January</i>, 1606, the Weather
being unsettled, but he as resolute as at other Times. He arriv&rsquo;d
at the Island <i>Mindanao</i>, then in Enmity with the
<i>Spaniards</i>, and in Confederacy with the <i>Ternates</i>, and came
to <span class="marginnote">Caldera <i>Port</i>.</span> an Anchor in
the Port of <i>Caldera</i>, to water, where the Admiral&rsquo;s Ship,
in which the Colonel <i>Esquivel</i> was, began to drag her Anchors,
and was forc&rsquo;d to set her Sails to get off; but perceiving she
could not, by so doing weather a Point, she fired two Guns, in Token of
Distress, at the Time <span class="marginnote"><i>Admiral Ship
lost.</i></span> when her Rudder struck. The Galleys made up to tow her
off, and broke some Ropes to no Purpose, the Sea and Wind being against
them. Captain <i>Villagra</i> was entrusted to save the Men and
Provisions that were aboard; and he, tho&rsquo; a considerable Part
belonging to the King and private Men was lost, with incredible
Industry sav&rsquo;d the most of them, and the Goods, as also all the
Men, Cannon, Powder, Cables, Rigging, and Sails; and that the People of
<i>Mindanao</i> might not reap the Benefit of the Wreck, he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name=
"pb240">240</a>]</span>set Fire to the Vessel, after taking out all the
Iron Work. This Accident was much lamented, both for its own
Consequence, and because the Men, who are often vainly Superstitious,
put an ill Construction upon it; but the General&rsquo;s Wisdom made
amends for all.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>They sail from</i> Caldera.</span> From
the Port of <i>Caldera</i>, the General order&rsquo;d the Colonel to
sail over to that of <i>Talangame</i>, which, as has been said, is in
the Island of <i>Ternate</i>; and bore him Company himself, with the
Galleys, till he was out of the Streight of <i>Sabuanga</i>, which is
dangerous by Reason of the Currents and Ridges of Rocks, wherefore they
tow&rsquo;d the Ships, till they were out of Danger, as also because
they were becalm&rsquo;d. The Fleet stood out to Sea; the Galleys
coasted along slowly to take in Water enough to last them to
<i>Ternate</i>, the Men that had been sav&rsquo;d from abroad the
Admiral being distributed among them, and the other Vessels, so that
their Burden and Labour <span class="marginnote"><i>Through Mistake
fall in with</i> Celebes.</span> was increased. The ablest pilots in
those Seas, had Charge of the Galleys, and yet notwithstanding all
their Care, and that of the Captains and expert <i>Mariners</i>, they
mistook their Course, and fell in among the islands of <i>Celebes</i>,
otherwise call&rsquo;d of <i>Mateo</i>, above 60 Leagues to the Leeward
of <i>Ternate</i>. The Wind was contrary, and the Error was to be

retriev&rsquo;d by rowing. With very much Labour they reach&rsquo;d
<i>Ternate</i> on the 26th of <i>March</i>, being <i>Easter-Day</i>.
That Day so joyful to all Mankind, made them forget past Toils, and
convert them into Pleasure and Delight.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Superstition of</i> Moluccos <i>as to
<span class="corr" id="xd21e28756" title=
"Source: Ecipses">Eclipses</span>.</i></span> They were inform&rsquo;d,
that the Day before, an Eclipse of the Moon had been observ&rsquo;d at
<i>Ternate</i>, with the usual Concern. No sooner does the Darkness
begin to cover the Body of the Moon, than the People with Sighs and
Tears begin also to lament that Planet&rsquo;s Mourning; for they
believe it forebodes the Death or Captivity of their King, or of some
eminent Person or some Calamity to the Publick. If the Eclipse passes
over without any of these Losses, they Repair to their <i>Mosque</i> in
Procession, Rank and File. Here the foremost carry large <i>China</i>
Dishes. Those are follow&rsquo;d by others with Launces, and Hatchets
advanc&rsquo;d, and Muskets rested. Next them follow three Lamps,
carry&rsquo;d on Men&rsquo;s Shoulders, as common Pictures represent
the great Bunch of Grapes carry&rsquo;d by the Discoverers, who went to
view the Holy Land promis&rsquo;d by God to his People. Next comes a
Boy, in Royal Robes, and behind him another holding an Umbrello, made
of various Feathers, over the Head of the first. Then follow the Women,
set off with Flowers and Palm-Branches, without Order; and thus they
celebrate their Thanksgiving, in the Streets and Temples, because the
Eclipse pass&rsquo;d over without any Detriment. The <i>Dutch</i> told
them, That Eclipses were commonly known in their Country, and
throughout all <i>Europe</i>; which those People either admir&rsquo;d
or did not believe.</p>
<p>When our Galleys came to the Port of <i>Talangame</i>, <i>Don
Pedro</i> expected to have found the Colonel with the Fleet in it; but
only saw a stately <span class="marginnote">Dutch <i>Ship at</i>
Talangame.</span> <i>Dutch</i> Ship, carrying 30 Pieces of Cannon, and
12 Pedreroes. She fought our Ships as they pass&rsquo;d by, and then
drew to the Shore, and defended herself with Part of the Artillery,
that was fittest for the Purpose, and being guarded by a great Number
of <i>Ternate</i> Soldiers, kept close in her Fortification. <i>Don
Pedro</i> took a View of her, as he pass&rsquo;d by in the Galleys,
tho&rsquo; she made several Shot at him, and threw 18 Pound Balls into
the Admiral <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name=
"pb241">241</a>]</span>Galley, where he was. He thought fit not to
stay, till he heard of the Fleet which was then at <i>Tydore</i>,
little above two Leagues from that Port, as was known by some Vessels
of the Natives, that came up board and board, in sailing by that
Harbour. The Galleys directed their Course to <i>Tydore</i>, led by the
Joy of this good News, which eas&rsquo;d <i>Don Pedro</i> of much Care
he was in, knowing there was a Scarcity of Seamen aboard the Fleet, and
he fear&rsquo;d it might have been drove away elsewhere.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Dutch <i>Men at</i> Tydore.</span>
<i>Esquivel</i> found four <i>Dutch</i> Men at <i>Tydore</i>. One of
them was the Factor who gather&rsquo;d the Clove for a Company of his
Countrymen, that belong&rsquo;d to the Factories of <i>Ternate</i>,
<i>Amboyna</i>, <i>Banda</i>, <i>Sunda</i>, and other Places about
them; the other three were Sailers. He examin&rsquo;d all four, and
they gave an Account of the Strength of that Ship, and her Guns,
saying, She was loden with Clove; and one of the five that fought the
<i>Portugueses</i>, when the Fort of <i>Ternate</i> blew up. That they
expected another Ship, which came <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Intelligence they give.</i></span> with her from
<i>Bantam</i>, and was parted in foul Weather. That the main Drift of
the Agreement made between the King of <i>Ternate</i> and the
<i>Dutch</i>, was their Assisting him against the <i>Spaniards</i>, and
<i>Portugueses</i>. That there were Orders at <i>Java</i> and
<i>Sunda</i> for the <i>Dutch</i> Ships which pass&rsquo;d by to
enquire there, whether there were any News from the <i>Moluccos</i>;
and if Need were, that they should leave their Loding there, and go
succour the King of <i>Ternate</i>.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Ternate <i>to be attack&rsquo;d before
the</i> Dutch <i>Ship.</i></span> Before <i>Don Pedro</i> departed
<i>Talangame</i>, he consulted with his Officers, whether it were
convenient to attack the <i>Dutch</i> Ship before they went upon the
Enterprize of <i>Ternate</i>. Opinions varied, but it was concluded,
that since his Majesties Design was to recover the <i>Maluccos</i>, and
he had order&rsquo;d the Fleet to be provided for that Intent, it was
not expedient to prefer any other Action. Time is subject to change,
and sometimes an Accident overthrows the best concerted Designs. That
great Ship, so well stor&rsquo;d with Guns, and Mann&rsquo;d, might
have sunk some of ours, by which we should have lost our Cannon, and
Provisions, or some other Mischief, that could not possibly be foreseen
might have happen&rsquo;d, to the obstructing of the main Design.
Besides that the <i>Ternates</i> being their Friends, in Case we had
master&rsquo;d the Ship, the Men might fly and save themselves among
their Confederates, and thus the Enterprize be rendered more difficult
by their Assistance; and it was known by Spyes, that the King already
had <i>Dutch</i> Gunners, and Soldiers of Courage and Conduct.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>King of</i> Tydore <i>and</i> Don Pedro
<i>meet at Sea.</i></span> The King was not at <i>Tydore</i> when our
Fleet came into his Harbour, being gone to marry a Daughter of the King
of <i>Bachian</i>; and tho&rsquo; the Colonel sent to acquaint him with
his Arrival, and to desire he would hasten his Coming, as fearing
Delays; yet perceiving the Time slipt away, he set out on the last of
<i>March</i> for <i>Ternate</i>, with his Fleet. When they were at Sea,
they heard the new marryed King&rsquo;s Bagpipes, Basons, Trumpets, and
Kettle-Drums. He having receiv&rsquo;d the <i>Spaniards</i> Letters,
imbark&rsquo;d, bringing the New Queen along with him, and joyn&rsquo;d
them with his <i>Carcoas</i> full of Musick and Garlands of Flowers.
They met with extraordinary Joy, and the King of <i>Tydore</i>
express&rsquo;d it particularly for seeing of <i>Don Pedro de
Accunna</i>, with whom he had before frequent Communication by Letters
and Messengers. He show&rsquo;d much Concern for the Streights he had
been reduc&rsquo;d to by the King of <i>Ternate</i>, with the
Assistance of the <i>Dutch</i>. <i>Don <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb242" href="#pb242" name="pb242">242</a>]</span>Pedro</i> comforted
him, declaring his Majesty&rsquo;s Intention, and how he had
order&rsquo;d him to come to his Assistance, from the <i>Philippine</i>
Islands, whensoever he should require it. He visited the Bride, paying
her all possible Respect; and the King of <i>Tydore</i>, telling him,
he would attend the Fleet in Person, with his Ships and Men, went away
then to his Island, and the next Morning, at Break of Day, according to
his Promise, came into a Bay near <span class="marginnote"><i>Orders
for the Enterprize.</i></span> <i>Ternate</i>, where our Fleet had
anchor&rsquo;d. The Rejoycings for his coming did not delay the
Consultations, and Orders for the Enterprize. The Governour
call&rsquo;d a Council of War, where it was resolv&rsquo;d, that all
the Strength of the Fleet should be reduc&rsquo;d to only three great
Ships, to secure the Sea and Land. They were immediately sufficiently
mann&rsquo;d with Sea-Men and Soldiers, under the Command of
<i>Bernardine Alfonso</i>, <i>Antony Carrenno de Valdes</i>, and <i>Don
Gil Sanchez de Carranza</i>, all three Commanders of Repute. Other
Orders were issu&rsquo;d out, and presently put in Execution by the
Officers. Of the three above nam&rsquo;d, two dy&rsquo;d in their
Return Home, and only <i>Carreno</i> out liv&rsquo;d it.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Forces land</i> April <i>the
first.</i></span> <i>Don Pedro</i>, and the King of <i>Tydore</i>
landed their Men, on the first of <i>April</i>, at Break of Day; but it
being difficult, and even dangerous to march so near the Water, because
there was no more ground on the Shore than for five Men in Rank; it was
resolv&rsquo;d to make the Attack with a small Number, gradually along
the Sea Coast, without ingaging too far; and at the same Time to make
Way over the Top of the Mountain, with some <i>Pampanguo</i>, and
<i>Tangalo Indian</i> Pioneers, and to send another Party of Men that
Way, to give the Enemy a Diversion, and oblige them to divide their
Forces. The King of <i>Ternate</i>, whom Experience and Fear had
instructed in the Art of War, perceiving what was aim&rsquo;d at, to
avoid being cut off in <span class="marginnote">K. <i>of</i> Ternate
<i>retires to his Fort.</i></span> the Rear, retir&rsquo;d to his Fort,
as soon as he discover&rsquo;d our Army. This was the Reason why our
Men met with no Opposition, whereas the General <i>Furtado</i> found so
much Resistance there, three Years before, at the Seige we have spoken
of, when in gaining that Pass, he lost some <i>Portugueses</i> and
<i>Spaniards</i>, being assisted by Captain <i>Gallinato</i>.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Gallinato <i>invests the Place.</i></span>
He now put our Men into good Order, leading the Van, and drew up within
Musket Shot of the Wall. He told <i>Don Pedro</i>, in the Presence of
the King of <i>Tydore</i>, that some Soldiers had, by his Command,
taken a View of the Place, and that considering the Nature of the
Situation, it was requisite to maintain that Ground till Night, when
our Men should intrench, and bring up the Cannon for Battery. His
Advice was approv&rsquo;d of, and put in Execution; and in Regard that
the Enemy did some Harm in the main Body, and Wings, with their Cannon
and small Shot; <i>Don Pedro</i> to prevent it, order&rsquo;d the Men
to lye down. It was observ&rsquo;d that there were <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Sentinels on Trees beaten off.</i></span> four
Eminences cover&rsquo;d with wild, and full headed Trees, on which the
Enemy had their Sentinels, who gave Intelligence how the
<i>Spaniards</i> mov&rsquo;d, and of whatsoever they order&rsquo;d, or
perform&rsquo;d. A Captain went up to make himself Master of the Trees,
and soon brought down the Enemies Sentinels. <i>Gallinato</i> perfected
that Work, commanding our Sentinels to get up into those same Trees, as
was done. The Enemy endeavour&rsquo;d to remove them with their Cannon
and small Arms, firing incessantly; but could never disturb either
those that were on the Top, among the Boughs, who gave the Information,
not the others that stood at the Foot, who receiv&rsquo;d and carryed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href="#pb243" name=
"pb243">243</a>]</span>it to the Officers. The Enemy was
possess&rsquo;d of a Post near the Bastion of <i>Cachil Tulo</i>, on
the right Hand of the Wall, a little beyond the Trees, and the General
thinking it necessary to be gain&rsquo;d, commanded Captain <i>John de
Cubas</i>, an old Low-Country Soldier, to attack it with 30 Musketiers,
and if he thought himself too hard set, to send Word, and he should
have a good Supply of Pikes. The Captain went on by the Way of the
Mountain, and the Enemy to prevent him, sent a Body of Men out of the
Fort next the Sea, whom Captain <i>Villagra</i> charg&rsquo;d. Whilst
they were ingag&rsquo;d, the King of <i>Ternate</i>, perceiv&rsquo;d
that <i>Cubas</i> was marching to gain his Post, and <span class=
"marginnote">Villagra <i>and</i> Cubas <i>fight the</i>
Ternates.</span> being sensible how prejudicial the Loss of it would
be, sally&rsquo;d out himself to fight him, and the <i>Spaniards</i>
had enough to do. <i>Cubas</i> gained the highest Ridge; but so
fatigued, that he was forc&rsquo;d to send for the Supply of Pikes. The
Captains <i>Vergara</i>, <i>Alarcon</i>, and <i>Don Roderick de
Mendoza</i> supported him with 40 detatch&rsquo;d Men; and before they
came up more <i>Ternates</i> and <i>Javaneses</i> sally&rsquo;d out of
the Fort, with whom the fight was renew&rsquo;d in more furious Manner.
Another Party of Infidels was presently discover&rsquo;d next the Sea,
for which Reason, and because, if the Enemy had demanded more Succours,
his Posts would be forsaken, the King order&rsquo;d those who fought
with <i>Villagra</i> to retire, and went himself with them, and some
others to sustain the Rest. His coming on like a brave, or rather a
desperate <span class="marginnote"><i>The Fight
redoubl&rsquo;d.</i></span> Commander, oblig&rsquo;d <i>Cubas</i>, to
ask for another Supply which the Captains <i>Villagra</i>, and
<i>Cervantes</i> carry&rsquo;d him, and charg&rsquo;d the Enemy.
<i>Cachil Amuxa</i>, of whose Bravery Mention has been made, went up to
Captain <i>Cubas</i> after burning the Brims of his Hat, and the
Feather in it, with a Musket Shot, and they both fought Hand to Hand
for a considerable Time, the one with his Sword, and the other with his
<i>Campilane</i>, or Cymiter. The <span class="marginnote"><i>Single
Combat.</i></span> Sentinels on the Trees cry&rsquo;d out, giving
Notice of the Troops on the Shore, and that they came on towards our
Van-Guard, and the Front of it. Captain <i>Villagra</i> was
order&rsquo;d to charge them with a Division of Shot, belonging to
Captain <i>Cervantes</i>, who commanded all the Halbardiers. Both
Parties fought with equal Tokens of Courage, when the Sentinels from
the Trees gave Notice, that <i>John de Cubas</i>, on the Right,
demanded more Succours. The Captains <i>Don Roderick de Mendoza</i>,
and <i>Pascual de Alarcon</i> went with it immediately, drawing out two
Divisions of Musketiers. The Sentinels cry&rsquo;d out again, that the
Enemy, who fought with Captain <i>Villagra</i> were retiring towards
the Walls, and that <i>John de Cubas</i> demanded another Supply of
Pikes and Halbards. Captain <i>Cervantes</i> supported him with 50, and
<i>Villagra</i>, with the Men he commanded.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Ternates <i>retire in Disorder.</i></span>
Our Sentinels, to whose Vigilancy a great Part of this Success is
owing, gave Notice again, that upon the Approach of our Supplies, the
Enemy retired in Disorder, and our Men made up to the Wall. The Event
of the Battle began now to be out of Doubt, and even in that Posture
requir&rsquo;d Diversity of Conduct. <i>Don Pedro</i> therefore
order&rsquo;d the Colours with the Rest of the Pikes to march, leaving
one Division of Musquetiers, and the Heavy Harquebussiers in the Rear,
to face the Enemy, in Case they should happen to sally out again toward
the Sea. The other Captains and Soldiers went on fighting, and at the
set Time attack&rsquo;d the Wall, helping one another to climb to the
Top. The two first that got upon it were the Captains <i>John de
Cubas</i>, and <i>Cervantes</i>, who having receiv&rsquo;d some Wounds
on it, tumbled <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name=
"pb244">244</a>]</span>down again. The Difficulty of this Enterprize
increas&rsquo;d as the Enemy renew&rsquo;d their Efforts, doing us Harm
with their heavy and small Cannon, Muskets, sundry Sort of Fireworks,
Stones, and other Contrivances the <i>Dutch</i> furnish&rsquo;d them
with; but the Attack was made so furiously, that the <i>Spaniards</i>
gave not the King, nor his Men Leisure enough to get into the old
<i>Portuguese</i> Fort, within the Wall; for had they done so, they
might have defended themselves some Time, and our Men would have been
oblig&rsquo;d to batter the Walls with Cannon; and tho&rsquo; the Fort
is small, and built in more unskilful Times, it would have cost
Trouble.</p>
<p>The Place was taken with little Loss, for we had but Fifteen Men
kill&rsquo;d on our Side, among them was Captain <i>Cervantes</i>, who
getting up the first <span class="marginnote"><i>The Place taken, and
Number of the Slain.</i></span> upon the Wall, with a Design to display
the King&rsquo;s Standard on it, was run into the Eye with a Launce, by
a Barbarian, and others coming on, they threw him down to the Ground,
whereof he dy&rsquo;d the seventh Day, much regretted by all Men. He
had before said publickly, offering to give the Charge, <i>Gentlemen,
the Bull shall not make his Escape my Way, unless it cost me my
Life</i>; alluding to keeping of him in at the Bull-Feasts. He was as
good as his Word both ways, since he dy&rsquo;d in Performance of it,
with his Arms and Legs broken. No Man of any Note, either among the
<i>Spaniards</i> or <i>Indians</i> escap&rsquo;d unhurt. Many
<i>Ternates</i> and <i>Javaneses</i> were slain, and some <i>Dutch</i>
shed their Blood, like brave or desperate Men, thinking it a
Misfortune, as they said, to owe their Lives to our Courtesy, or
Mercy.</p>
<p>It was never expected that the Success, would be in all Points
answerable to the Justice of the Cause. <i>Don Pedro</i> had
design&rsquo;d to batter the Forts, wherein he would have met with
mighty Difficulties, because the Cannon was very heavy, and hard to be
drawn to the proper Posts for Battery; as also for that there was not
Earth to fill the Gabions, and the <span class="marginnote"><i>Cannon
found in it.</i></span> Rockiness of the Ground obstructed the throwing
up of the Trenches, which would have occasion&rsquo;d the Loss of many
Men before the Artillery could be planted. The <i>Spaniards</i>
pursu&rsquo;d their Success, and possessing themselves of the Fort,
found in it 43 large Brass Guns, abundance of Drakes, and other Arms,
besides Ammunition and Provisions.</p>
<p>The Men having enter&rsquo;d the City, every one fell to plunder,
and commit <span class="marginnote"><i>Prisoners made
Slaves.</i></span> Outrages. <i>Don Pedro</i> had made Proclamation,
that all the Enemies taken within four Days should be made Slaves. The
Commanders halted near the ancient Church of S. <i>Paul</i>, which was
fortify&rsquo;d by the Enemy with Ramparts for this Service. Opinions
vary&rsquo;d about what was next to be done; Some were for securing
what was already gain&rsquo;d; Others for pushing on, to gain the main
Fort. The Captains <i>Vergara</i> and <i>Villagra</i>, went for the
Latter, and the Soldiers were so brisk and eager to run into any
Danger, that one of them, of the Province of <i>Estremadura</i>, and
belonging <span class="marginnote"><i>Eagerness of the Men.</i></span>
to the Company of Captain <i>Sevil</i>, an <i>Aragonian</i>, and
notable Commander, who was also for going on, took up Captain
<i>Villagra</i> in his Arms, and carry&rsquo;d him above ten Paces,
saying, <i>Good Captain, fall on, fall on</i>; and then set him down.
The Captain struck him, for having <span class="marginnote"><i>They
attack and take the main Fort.</i></span> taken him up so rudely, at
such a Time; and the Soldier bowing, pleasantly and with a smiling
Countenance, said to him, <i>God is my Life, strike again, and fall
on</i>. In short, <i>Vergara</i> and <i>Villagra</i>, with a few Men
attack&rsquo;d <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name=
"pb245">245</a>]</span>the main Fort, and carry&rsquo;d it, being
themselves the first that enter&rsquo;d <span class=
"marginnote"><i>They attack and take the main Fort.</i></span> the
Gates, but not the first that went up; for as they were running up the
Stairs hastily, and just going into the Hall, <i>Barela</i>,
<span class="corr" id="xd21e29300" title="Source: and">an</span> old
Soldier, and Corporal to Captain <i>Cervantes</i>, thrust by their
Side, and getting in, took a gilt Ewre, made in the Shape of an Urn,
curiously ingrav&rsquo;d, from off a rich Cupboard, or Side-board there
was in the Hall, saying to the Captains, <span class=
"marginnote"><i>The King&rsquo;s Palace plunder&rsquo;d.</i></span>
<i>Gentlemen, I take this in Token that I came in here with you</i>;
and carry&rsquo;d it away, by their Consent. All the Palace was then
expos&rsquo;d to the Avarice of the Soldiers. <i>Don Pedro</i> would
have given a check to it; but was not taken Notice of, till almost all
was over.</p>
<p>The King of <i>Ternate</i> had forsaken all, and some of the
<i>Dutch</i> him, when <span class="marginnote"><i>The King</i> &amp;c.
<i>fly, to</i> Gilolo.</span> they saw he was going down; none
follow&rsquo;d him in this Confusion and Flight, but the
<i>Sangiack</i> of <i>Mofaquia</i>, his Kinsman, who encourag&rsquo;d
and advis&rsquo;d him, his Queen <i>Celicaya</i>, and some other Women.
He embark&rsquo;d with them all, Prince <i>Gariolano</i> his Son, and a
few <i>Dutch</i>, in great Haste, within the Wall, aboard some
<i>Carcoas</i> of <i>Mofaquia</i>, and plying the Oars, or rather
Flying, arriv&rsquo;d in the Island of <i>Gilolo</i>, at a Fort there,
built not long before in <i>Sabugu</i>. The rest of the <i>Dutch</i>
got off in other Vessels to their Ship.</p>
<p>The whole Body of the Army now rang&rsquo;d the Towns and Houses of
the <span class="marginnote"><i>The</i> Dutch <i>to their
Ship.</i></span> Natives, wholly intent upon Plunder, and <i>Don
Pedro</i> went about, giving Orders, and checking the Soldiers, that
they might keep in a Body.</p>
<p>The General went on to S. <i>Paul</i>&rsquo;s Church, which was
unroof&rsquo;d and profan&rsquo;d; he order&rsquo;d it to be
cleans&rsquo;d, and immediately adorn&rsquo;d with <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Possession taken of the Fort.</i></span> Boughs, and
other Ornaments, brought thither by the diligent Soldiers, where they
devoutly, with loud Voices, sang the Hymn, <i>Salve Regina</i>, which
our Church uses to call upon the blessed Virgin. For the compleating of
this Victory, they still wanted to seize the King, Prince,
<i>Sangiacks</i>, and Commanders that follow&rsquo;d him. The General
took Possession of the Forts, setting up and displaying the Colours,
with the Arms of the Crown of <i>Spain</i>, and the Name of
<span class="ex">PHILIP <i>THE THIRD, OUR SOVEREIGN</i></span>, the
Musick playing, and Guns firing. He order&rsquo;d, <span class=
"marginnote"><i>King of</i> Ternate <i>pursu&rsquo;d.</i></span> that
the next Day Captain <i>Villagra</i> should set out in Pursuit of the
King of <i>Ternate</i>, with 100 Men in two Galleys, and the King of
<i>Tydore</i>, and the Prince his Son, with their Fleet, consisting of
two <i>Janguas</i>, and 15 <i>Carcoas</i>, in which were 1000 Men.</p>
<p>The King and Prince of <i>Tydore</i>, with Captain <i>Villagra</i>,
came to the <span class="marginnote">Tacome <i>Fort surrender&rsquo;d
to</i> Villagra.</span> Fort of <i>Tacome</i>, in <i>Ternate</i>, on
the third of <i>April</i>, where they found <i>Cachil Amuxa</i>, the
bravest of the Natives of <i>Ternate</i>, Cousin German to their King,
and his Captain General. <i>Villagra</i> sent him a Message by
<i>Antony de Silva</i>, Interpreter of their Language, and through his
Means he surrendred, with some <i>Dutch</i>; all whom he carry&rsquo;d
Prisoners to the City. He brought them in very honourable Manner, and
they had not the dejected Looks of Men that were overcome. Being come
to the City, he deliver&rsquo;d them to <i>Don Pedro de Acunna</i>, who
observing the same Generosity, received and treated them courteously,
and commended their Valour. There the <i>Cachil</i> and Captain <i>John
de Cubas</i> knew one another again, remember&rsquo;d the Wounds they
had given and receiv&rsquo;d, and were good Friends. The
<i>Portuguese</i> Commanders visited him, and in his Presence, after
commending <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246" name=
"pb246">246</a>]</span>the Bravery they had shown in the War, the
General, with his <span class="marginnote"><i>The General honours
the</i> Portuguese <i>Commanders.</i></span> own Hands, put weighty
Gold Chains about their Necks, as was then us&rsquo;d among Soldiers,
desiring they would accept of that Acknowledgement of their gallant
Behaviour, and excuse the Smallness of the Gift; and they on their
Side, made suitable Returns of Courtesy.</p>
<p><i>Villagra</i> went out again, and by the Way, took the
<i>Sangiack</i> of <i>Mofaquia</i>, and two of his Nephews, without any
Opposition. All these having desir&rsquo;d Audience of <i>Don
Pedro</i>, told him, they had always been desirous to <span class=
"marginnote">Sangiack <i>of</i> Mofaquia <i>taken.</i></span> return to
their Subjection under his Majesty, but that their Kinsman, the King,
had obstructed it, and ruin&rsquo;d himself by adhereing to his own
Opinion, rejecting the safest and best, which was to recover their
former Favour. <i>This Pride</i>, said they, <i>has reduc&rsquo;d him
to the miserable Condition he</i> <span class="marginnote"><i>He
proposes to bring over the King.</i></span> <i>is now in. If you please
we will discourse, and perswade him to put himself into your Hands,
after you have taken such Security of us as becomes conquer&rsquo;d
Men, and given Commission to such as you can confide in to Article with
the King. It is not the Change of our Fortune that moves us to this,
for none can daunt those who are prepar&rsquo;d for the worst; but it
is that Fidelity, which the Circumstances of the Times would not permit
us to exert.</i> <span class="marginnote">Don Pedro<i>&rsquo;s
Answer.</i></span> <i>Don Pedro</i> return&rsquo;d Thanks for their
Zeal, and told them, The Method they had chosen was the best to oblige
the King of <i>Spain</i> to use that Victory with his innate royal
Goodness; and therefore empower&rsquo;d them to assure the King, and
his Son, that their Lives should be safe. The two <i>Cachiles</i>
embarking with <i>Paul de Lima</i>, who, tho&rsquo; a Native of
<i>Ternate</i>, was discreet and a Master of the <i>Spanish</i> Tongue,
as also well known to the King, and with Captain <i>Villagra</i>, they
sail&rsquo;d over together to the Fort of <i>Sabubu</i>, in the Island
<i>Batochina</i>. The King embrac&rsquo;d, and receiv&rsquo;d them with
Tears; but when they propos&rsquo;d his surrend&rsquo;ring himself, he
would <span class="marginnote"><i>The King delivers himself up on a
safe Conduct.</i></span> not consent without a formal safe Conduct
first granted. That Satisfaction was soon given him, for <i>Don
Pedro</i> sent it, with Assurance of his Life, in respectful Terms,
becoming the Person of a King, and all solid and safe, according to the
Power committed to him, the Rest being left at his Catholick
Majesty&rsquo;s Disposal.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Embarks for</i> Ternate.</span> The
Instrument, which the General had drawn in Form, being read, the King
resolv&rsquo;d to repair to <i>Ternate</i>, with the Prince, and the
other <i>Cachiles</i> and <i>Sangiacks</i>; yet contrary to the Advice
of <i>Celicaya</i>, of whom he was always desperately in Love. In fine,
he put himself into the Hands of <i>Don Pedro</i>, and to this Effect
embark&rsquo;d on three <i>Janguas</i>, and meeting with
<i>Villagra</i>, they went over with all the rest into his Galleys, to
be carry&rsquo;d to the General. The King desir&rsquo;d by the Way to
visit his Mother, who was in the Fort of <i>Tacome</i>, and having
propos&rsquo;d it to Captain <i>Villagra</i>, he comply&rsquo;d with
him, and the Galleys made haste. They came to <i>Tacome</i> on the 8th
of <i>April</i>, where he landed, and his Mother coming out to meet
him, encourag&rsquo;d him, without showing the least Dejectedness.
<span class="marginnote"><i>Visits his Mother.</i></span> Nothing
appear&rsquo;d in the Discourse between them that could be heard, that
had a Womanish Air, or the Resemblance of a Motherly Tenderness, as the
Interpreters declar&rsquo;d, nor did she comfort him with Hopes of
Revenge, but only with Reasons perswading to sute himself to his
Fortune, which is the Will of Heaven. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb247" href="#pb247" name="pb247">247</a>]</span></p>
<p>From this Place <i>Villagra</i> sent Advice to <i>Don Pedro</i>,
that the King was come, and would soon be with him. He having
receiv&rsquo;d the News, sent <span class="marginnote"><i>The King
brought to</i> Ternate.</span> Major <i>Ascueta</i> to bid him welcome.
He order&rsquo;d he should be treated with Respect, and that the Major
should in secret bid Captain <i>Villagra</i> make haste to
<i>Ternate</i>, because there was much still to do, and it was not
proper to lose Time. The Progress of Victory is not to be interrupted.
They set out in the Evening for <i>Ternate</i>, where they
arriv&rsquo;d late at Night, and therefore went not into the City. The
King stood as it were amaz&rsquo;d when he saw the Place, and heard the
Drums, and other Martial Noises; being sensible of the Yoke he had been
so averse to bear. However he diverted <span class="marginnote"><i>The
King of</i> Tydore <i>goes to visit him.</i></span> himself that Night,
as a sick Person uses to admit of the Entertainment he receives from
those who are in Health. The next Day the General came aboard, whilst
the Army was forming into one great Body, and the Companies were
marching, that the King might not stay; that Show being provided for
him, and the Design that he should be conducted in through the Midst of
the Forces. <i>Don Pedro</i> order&rsquo;d, That before he landed, the
King of <i>Tydore</i>, who attended in the same Harbour, should go
visit him. He refus&rsquo;d to receive him, as long as he could, and
the Colonel and all the Captains intreated him to admit of the Visit,
which he at length consented to, either being perswaded, or yielding to
Importunity. The Galley made towards the King of <i>Tydore</i>&rsquo;s
Fleet, and as they drew near, the Cannon fir&rsquo;d. The King of
<i>Tydore</i> stay&rsquo;d aboard his Admiral, conceal&rsquo;d between
Curtains of Crimson Damask, and when the two Galleys <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Barbarous Ceremonies of the Kings.</i></span> were come
together board and board, after a long Silence, the Curtains were
drawn. Both the Kings appear&rsquo;d in their Vessels, looking at one
another, for a considerable Time, without speaking a Word. At length he
of <i>Ternate</i>, as the conquer&rsquo;d, call&rsquo;d to one of his
Nephews, to whom kneeling, he deliver&rsquo;d a Message in his Ear for
the King of <i>Tydore</i>. The Nephew <span class="marginnote">Zumbaya
<i>Ceremony.</i></span> went over to the <i>Carcoa</i>, and having made
the <i>Zumbaya</i>, according to their Ceremonies, with great Tokens of
Submission, kneeling, joyning his Hands, and raising them up to his
Face, kiss&rsquo;d the King of <i>Tydore</i>&rsquo;s left Foot. Then he
deliver&rsquo;d him his Message with much Deliberation, all the
Standers-by observing the knitting of his Brows, and all the other
Tokens of Admiration and Sorrow, wherewith he was heard. The Nephew
withdrew as soon as he had done speaking; and after the King of
<i>Tydore</i> had continu&rsquo;d a while Thoughtful, he call&rsquo;d
another <i>Cachil</i>, who was his Favourite, and Kinsman. He spoke to
him in the same Manner, and gave him another Message for the King of
<i>Ternate</i>, with much Deliberation and State. This Messenger paid
him the same respectful Ceremonies, and going over to our Galley, when
he came into the Presence of the King of <i>Ternate</i>, after
performing the same <i>Zumbaya</i>, bow&rsquo;d himself down, and
deliver&rsquo;d the Answer. The King receiv&rsquo;d it with as much
Grandeur as he could have done had he been Conqueror. Then he also
stood a while musing, and rising went over to the Admiral of
<i>Tydore</i>, which, as has been <span class="marginnote"><i>Meeting
of the two Kings.</i></span> said, was grappled with the Galley. The
Prince, his Son, and the Commanders attended him. The King of
<i>Tydore</i> stood up to receive him. When they met, each of them
us&rsquo;d tedious Civilities, and Ceremonies towards the other, about
sitting. He of <i>Ternate</i> sat first, and the Prince, by his
Father&rsquo;s Order, paid him of <i>Tydore</i>, the Respect of the
<i>Zumbaya</i>, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248"
name="pb248">248</a>]</span>kissing his Foot. He to prevent obliging
his Son to repay the like Compliment to the other, before the King of
<i>Ternate</i> came, had order&rsquo;d him aboard another Vessel, and
to put out to Sea, that he might not be present at the Interview. The
two Kings discours&rsquo;d about several Affairs, and he of
<i>Ternate</i>, of his Misfortune, tho&rsquo; in manly Manner.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The two Kings land.</i></span> It being
now Time for the King of <i>Ternate</i> to land, both the Kings began
to draw near it, but with different Notions. The General waited in the
Fort, and saw the Landing from the Top of it. The King of
<i>Ternate</i> came ashore between and led by the Colonel, and
<i>Gallinato</i>. After him follow&rsquo;d the Prince, conducted by
Captain <i>Villagra</i>, and the Major. The King march&rsquo;d
thro&rsquo; a Lane of our Foot, and seem&rsquo;d pleas&rsquo;d to see
them so gallant, and orderly. Thus he came to the Fort, the ancient
Residence of his Predecessors, and not long since his own, <i>Don
Pedro</i>, the Governour coming down to the Gate to meet him,
unarm&rsquo;d, richly dress&rsquo;d, and with <span class=
"marginnote">Don Pedro <i>receives the King.</i></span> such Decency as
became his Person. He would have kiss&rsquo;d his Hand, but the King
embrac&rsquo;d him, and they went up Hand in Hand to the Lodgings; in
the Stateliest whereof, they found three Chairs, with as many Cushions
before them, plac&rsquo;d on a rich Carpet under the Canopy. The King
sat on that in the Middle, the Prince on the next, and the Governour on
the third. After a short Silence, the Discourse began, <i>Don Pedro</i>
telling the King, his Highness ought to bear his present Condition with
Resolution, remembering the long Prosperity he had enjoy&rsquo;d. That
he offer&rsquo;d to interceed, <span class="marginnote"><i>Comforts
him.</i></span> and use his Interest with his Majesty, that he might be
restor&rsquo;d to his Kingdoms; and that the Subject in Hand requiring
longer and private Conferences, he for the Present would cut it short,
because the settling of weighty Affairs, is not to be grounded on the
Noise of Promises. <span class="marginnote"><i>The King&rsquo;s
Answer.</i></span> The King return&rsquo;d Thanks for the Kindness he
show&rsquo;d, in promising his Restitution, and bewailing his present
Condition, concluded, saying, That he took Comfort in him, considering
Heaven had reserv&rsquo;d him to be subdu&rsquo;d by so great a
Commander; in which particular he reckon&rsquo;d he was much
oblig&rsquo;d to his Fortune; and that he confided, he would treat him
with such Generosity and Goodness as was due on his own Account, and
his being the Minister of so great a Monarch, without calling to mind
that his own Pride had been his Ruin. The Governour satisfy&rsquo;d him
as to all Points, and having order&rsquo;d the best House in
<i>Ternate</i> to be furnish&rsquo;d, and <span class=
"marginnote"><i>A</i> <span class="corr" id="xd21e29766" title=
"Source: Spansh">Spanish</span> <i>Company guards the King.</i></span>
sent to it Plate, Household Goods, Linnen, Beds, Pavillions, and all
Things answerable to such a Guest, he desir&rsquo;d the King would be
pleas&rsquo;d to remove thither, and with his leave he would wait on
him; and that, with his good liking, a <i>Spanish</i> Captain with his
Company should guard his Person; lest the Subjects of the Kingdom of
<i>Tydore</i>, his natural Enemies, who were then very Numerous in the
City, seeing him alone, should offer any Rudeness. The King accepted of
it, smiling in a heavy Manner, to signify that the Guard was appointed
to secure him, and all the other Prisoners, and that he was sensible of
the false Gloss they gave it.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>He desires the Company of Captain</i>
Villagra.</span> Captain <i>Peter Delgado</i> was order&rsquo;d with
his Company to guard the King&rsquo;s House, and attend him, till
reliev&rsquo;d. That Night the King was very melancholy, being among so
many Strangers, and though it was late, would not go to Bed, till he
had sent <i>Sylva</i>, the <i>Portuguese</i> Interpreter, to desire the
General, that for some Comfort in his Solitude, this being the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name=
"pb249">249</a>]</span>Request of a conquer&rsquo;d Person, he would
send him Captain <i>Villagra</i>, whom, as the first <i>Spaniard</i> he
had been acquainted with, he lov&rsquo;d, call&rsquo;d him Father and
delighted in his Company. The King is reported to have said, that to
converse with the Conquerors, is only to hasten being overcome, and
make the Change of Fortune Habitual. The Governour was glad he could
afford him that Satisfaction; and sending immediately for Captain
<i>Villagra</i>, desir&rsquo;d he would go divert the King, and make
much of, and entertain him with Art, that he might be comforted. The
Captain readily comply&rsquo;d, and the King express&rsquo;d singular
Satisfaction in his Company. He supp&rsquo;d, and went to Bed,
discoursing all the while with the Captain concerning Martial and
Religious Affairs.</p>
<p>Two Days after the Governour directed Colonel <i>Gallinato</i> and
Captain <i>Villagra</i>, together with <i>Paul de Lima</i>, to propose
to the King to enter into Treaty with him, in his Majesty&rsquo;s Name,
for settling Things in a State of Security, and Safety; and to perswade
him, that was the Way to deserve <span class="marginnote"><i>Treaty set
afoot with the King.</i></span> well, and put himself into a better
Condition. They three went to him, attended by other Persons of Note,
and among them some religious Men of the Orders of <i>S. Augustin</i>,
and <i>S. Dominick</i>, and the Society of <i>Jesus</i>, who all
behav&rsquo;d themselves commendably in their Stations. The King did
not refuse to capitulate, and after settling the Form, by the
Interposition of <i>Paul de Lima</i>, and granting some Things he
desir&rsquo;d of the King of <i>Spain</i>, the following Articles were
drawn and sign&rsquo;d.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Articles between the General and King
of</i> Ternate. <i>The King to deliver up all Forts.</i></span> The
first Thing requir&rsquo;d of <i>Cachil Sultan Zayde</i>, King of
<i>Ternate</i>, and of the rest who are Prisoners with his Highness, is
that he shall deliver up to his Majesty King <i>Philip</i> our
Sovereign, the Forts he is now possess&rsquo;d of, being those of
<i>Gilolo</i>, <i>Sabubu</i>, <i>Gamocanora</i>, <i>Tacome</i>, those
of <i>Machian</i>, those of <i>Sula</i>, and the Rest. To this he
answers, that he will deliver up to his Majesty the aforesaid Forts,
and to that Effect, will send the Prince his Son, and His Kinsman
<i>Cachil Amuxa</i>, with the Persons appointed to take Possession of
them, and that they shall be deliver&rsquo;d up, with all the Cannon,
Ammunitions, Muskets, and Fire-Arms there are in them.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>To release Prisoners.</i></span>
<i>Secondly</i>, That he shall restore all the Prisoners he has, either
Christians, or Infidels, being our Subjects, as well of the Provinces
of the <i>Pintados</i>, as of the Rest that are subject to the
<i>Spaniards</i> in the <i>Philippine</i> Islands. He answer&rsquo;d,
that all such as can be found at present shall be deliver&rsquo;d, and
the Rest hereafter as they are discover&rsquo;d.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>To deliver up the</i> Dutch.</span>
<i>Thirdly</i>, That he shall deliver up the <i>Dutch</i> he has in his
Power. He answer&rsquo;d, That when he departed the Fort of
<i>Ternate</i>, 13 or 14 that were with him fled; and he supposes they
repair&rsquo;d to the <i>Dutch</i> Ship, because he has not seen them
since; but if they shall be found, he will deliver them
immediately.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>And Renegado</i> Spaniards.</span>
<i>Fourthly</i>, He shall deliver up the Renegado <i>Spaniards</i> that
were in the Fort of <i>Ternate</i>. He answer&rsquo;d, that there was
but one, and he fled as well as the Rest the Day the Fort was taken;
that he knows not where he is, but will cause Search to be made, and
deliver him.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Also</i> Batochina, Moratay, &amp;
Herrao.</span> <i>Fifthly</i>, That he shall deliver up all the Towns
which are in Batochina, and is call&rsquo;d <i>El Moro</i>, they having
been formerly Christians; as also the Islands of <i>Moratay</i>, and
<i>Herrao</i>, which were also Christian, with all the Artillery and
Ammunition there is in them. He answer&rsquo;d, he is ready to deliver
up all, as he had done his Person. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250"

<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Form of rendering the Capitulation
authentick.</i></span> These Articles <i>Don Pedro de Acunna</i>,
Governour, and Captain General of the <i>Philippine</i> Islands,
President of the Royal Court residing in them, and General of this
Fleet in the <i>Moluccos</i>, committed to the General <i>John Xuarez
Gallinato</i>, and to Captain <i>Christopher de Villagra</i>, who
concluded them in the Form as above, by the Interposition of <i>Paul de
Lima</i>, a <i>Portuguese</i> born in these Islands, who serv&rsquo;d
as Interpreter of the Languages. And the said King subscrib&rsquo;d his
Name, after his Manner. Given in the Fort of <i>Ternate</i>, on the
tenth of <i>April</i>, 1606. The said General, and Captain also
sign&rsquo;d it with the said <i>Paul de Lima</i>.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>How it was sign&rsquo;d.</i></span> The
King sign&rsquo;d in <i>Persian</i> Characters, with graceful
Flourishes, and the <i>Spaniards</i> plainly; and this Original
Capitulation was brought into <i>Spain</i>, with the other authentick
Instruments.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Commanders go to take
Possession.</i></span> In Pursuance to this Agreement, the Commanders
imbark&rsquo;d to take Possession of the several Places, carrying along
with them the King and Prince, and other Prisoners in two Galleys being
the Admiral, and Vice-Admiral, with all <i>Villagra</i>&rsquo;s
Company, and Part of that of <i>Cervantes</i>. The first Place taken
Possession of was the Fort of <i>Tacome</i>, next that of <i>Sula</i>,
both in the Island of <i>Ternate</i>. Thence they sail&rsquo;d to the
great <i>Batochina</i>, where are those of <i>Gilolo</i>, formerly a
flourishing Kingdom; of <i>Sabubu</i>, and <i>Gamocanora</i>,
<span class="marginnote">Gamocanora <i>what it signifies.</i></span>
which we corruptly call <i>Gran Bocanora</i>; but in that Country
Language, <i>Gamo</i> signifies Middle, and <i>Canora</i> Land, so that
<i>Gamocanora</i>, altogether signifies, Mid-Land, because it lies in
the midst of <i>Gilolo</i>, and <i>El Moro</i>. Possession was taken of
all these Forts, none landing but <i>Villagra</i>, with <i>Cachil
Amuxa</i>, <i>Antony de Sylva</i>, and <i>John de Vega</i>, who did the
Part of a Notary, being appointed, and authoriz&rsquo;d for that Time.
The <i>Cachil</i> assembled the People at all the Forts, acquainted
them with the Success of <i>Ternate</i>, and that all was now subject
to the <i>Spaniards</i>, by whose Authority that Captain <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Manner of taking Possession.</i></span> came to take
Possession, that so all might pay their Obedience to his Majesty. The
People having been attentive to what was propos&rsquo;d to them, knelt
down, and raising their voices made the <i>Zumbaya</i>. Then the
Captain display&rsquo;d the Standard advancing it in his
Majesty&rsquo;s Name, to denote Possession. Then he commanded the
Natives to bring out the Cannon, and draw it down to the Shore, to be
imbark&rsquo;d aboard the Galleys. This was the Method observed at
<i>Gilolo</i>, and in other Places of less Note.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>K. of</i> Tydore <i>recovers his
Towns.</i></span> In the mean while, the King of <i>Tydore</i>, making
his Advantage of the Victory, sent the Prince his Son with some Troops,
to possess himself of the Towns the King of <i>Ternate</i> had taken
for him, as he actually did. <i>Don Pedro</i> being inform&rsquo;d of
it, was offended that an Enterprize should be undertaken without his
Order, and thinking the King of <i>Tydore</i> had therein given Tokens
of Distrust, and Disrespect, had Thoughts of taking such Satisfaction,
as he judg&rsquo;d the Matter deserv&rsquo;d; but the King of
<i>Tydore</i> reflecting on his Misbehaviour, and that the Governours
Resentment swell&rsquo;d up to absolute Indignation, he found Means to
appease him, excusing himself, and saying, that Invasion had been
carry&rsquo;d on without his Order, or Knowledge; and desisting
expected to be restor&rsquo;d by <i>Don Pedro</i>, as we shall soon
see.</p>
<p>The Method observ&rsquo;d at other Forts, could not be followed at
that of <i>Sabubu</i>, where Queen <i>Celycaya</i> was, because
<i>Cachil Amuxa</i> fell sick, or pretended so to do. <i>Villagra</i>
had Regard to the Circumstances of Times. <i>Cachil Rete</i>,
<i>Sangiack</i> of <i>Gamocanora</i>, the King&rsquo;s Nephew, and a
brave Soldier, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251" name=
"pb251">251</a>]</span><span class="marginnote"><i>The People of</i>
Sabubu <i>in Arms.</i></span> landed instead of the other. The People
of that Town imagin&rsquo;d, that <i>Villagra</i> brought considerable
Forces, and therefore to secure the Queen, and themselves, they
gather&rsquo;d above 2500 fighting Men, under Pretence they would not
suffer <i>Celycaya</i> to be taken away. They hid themselves with their
Arms, yet not so but that the Captain knew of it. He took no Notice,
but coming up to one of the Bastions of the Town, which were both next
the River, drew off the Cannon, some few of the Natives, and those Boys
helping him; the Rest waiting for more considerable Action, in Arms.
Then he disarm&rsquo;d the other Bastion, assisted by <i>Francis
Romanico</i>, and <i>John Rodriguez Bermejo</i>, Captains of the
Galleys. The Town stands on the Bank of a River, up which they had run
in their Boats; but returning with the <span class="marginnote">Cachil
Rete.</span> Men that row&rsquo;d, the Guns were loaded, the
<i>Sangiack Rete</i> forwarding of it. He finding the People in an
Uproar, would not have had the Cannon carry&rsquo;d away, at that Time.
Possession was not taken till afterwards, out of Respect to the Queen,
and by Reason of the Mutiny of the People, who escap&rsquo;d not
unchastis&rsquo;d. The Galleys return&rsquo;d to <i>Gamocanora</i>, and
not being able to get into the River, nor to stay out, because of the
Flats, where an indifferent Wind may do much Harm, the least Part
whereof was the Loss of the Vessels; <i>Gallinato</i> therefore
considering, that if they should be cast away, the King was in his own
Country, whence it would be impossible to get him out again, tho&rsquo;
a greater Power should be gather&rsquo;d for that End, than what came
from the <i>Philippine</i> Islands, and having consulted with him about
the Method to be us&rsquo;d to get in to <i>Gamocanora</i>, the
<i>Sangiack</i> of that <span class="marginnote"><i>His Advice to
the</i> Spaniards.</span> Place said to him. <i>Sir, if you have such
Confidence in me, as I know you may, and my Advice is of any Force with
you, do not go thither with these Galleys, for you will expose them to
Shoals, and Winds. Since therefore here are two</i> Carcoas <i>of</i>
Tydore, <i>let the Captain</i> Villagra, <i>the Notary, and the
Interpreter go aboard them, and I will go along with them to my
Country, where the same shall be done, as if the Galleys went
in.</i></p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Villagra <i>trusts the</i> Sangiack.</span>
<i>Gallinato</i> consulted with <i>Villagra</i>, and they
approv&rsquo;d of the Method, setting out in the <i>Carcoas</i> on
<i>Saturday</i> in the Afternoon, and on <i>Sunday</i> Morning a League
short of the River, the <i>Sangiack</i> told the Captain, he well knew
he had been long from his Country, attending the King, and that his
Subjects had no certain Account of him, and therefore, they might then
as they us&rsquo;d to do at other Times, come out to the Mouth of the
River with a Fleet, to guard the Entrance. That if it should so happen,
he must not he disturb&rsquo;d, for they should all serve him. The
Captain, told him, how much he confided in him, since he had so easily
follow&rsquo;d his Advice, and was come to his Country almost Naked;
and that whatsoever happen&rsquo;d he would not <span class=
"marginnote"><i>He appeases his Subjects.</i></span> mistrust him.
Being come near the Mouth of the River, they saw 13 Vessels come out,
and when in the Sea, they drew up in a half Moon, and made up to
enclose the Captain&rsquo;s <i>Carcoa</i>. The <i>Sangiack</i> seeing
them near at Hand, went forward, and calling out, commanded them to be
peaceable. As soon as they knew him, they obey&rsquo;d, drew together
their Vessels, and came to speak to him. He enquir&rsquo;d into the
Posture of his Affairs, and ask&rsquo;d whether his Mother was there.
They said she was, and gave him a long Account of all Things. They went
before to carry his Mother the News of his Coming, and he order&rsquo;d
them to assemble all the People of the Town, and that none should
appear arm&rsquo;d, for they never us&rsquo;d to lay aside their
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name=
"pb252">252</a>]</span><i>Campilanes</i>. Being come in, they found
all, and even the Women got together, <span class="marginnote"><i>A
Vessel sail&rsquo;d by none but Women.</i></span> and imbarking again,
met the <i>Sangiacks</i> Mother in the Middle of the River, she then
coming down, to see her Son, in a Vessel all full of Women, clad in
several Sorts of Silks, with high Feathers, and several of them
arm&rsquo;d. Some handed the Sails, others ply&rsquo;d the Oares, and
others attended about that Princesses Person, so that there was not one
Man among them.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Meeting of the</i> Sangiack <i>and his
Mother.</i></span> The Mother being impatient, advanc&rsquo;d as soon
as ever she came to her Son&rsquo;s <i>Carcoa</i>; but he more nimbly
leap&rsquo;d into that Vessel of Women, and after paying the due
Respect to his Mother, there pass&rsquo;d extraordinary Demonstrations
of Love on both Sides, she imbracing, and kissing her Son. Thus they
all went up the River, against the Stream, till they came to the Town.
On both the Banks there appear&rsquo;d People clad in gay Manner, with
Feathers, but unarm&rsquo;d, and the <i>Sangiack</i> having
desir&rsquo;d his Mother to go ashore, all the Prime Men to perswade
her leap&rsquo;d into the Water, and carryed her in their Arms. The
<i>Sangiack</i> and <i>Villagra</i> came to the Market-Place, in the
midst whereof they found an Arbour, or Hut made of Boughs, on Timbers,
and in it two Chairs, on a Carpet. They set down with the usual
Ceremonies, and the <i>Sangiack</i> declar&rsquo;d to his Subjects,
that all the Dominions of the King of <i>Ternate</i>, and their
Persons, were then subject to the King of <i>Spain</i>, as he was
himself. That hereupon follow&rsquo;d the Obligation of delivering up
the Forts to him, and he was possess&rsquo;d of all the Rest, only that
being wanting. That they should so order that Captain <i>Villagra</i>
<span class="marginnote"><i>His great Submission to the</i>
Spaniards.</span> might take Possession of it and the Artillery.
<i>Villagra</i> intreated the <i>Sangiack</i> to go see his Wife, and
Children, and he would receive the Surrender of the Fort, and Arms, in
the Afternoon; but he answer&rsquo;d, that he came not to rejoyce with
his Family, but to serve the King of <i>Spain</i>. Afterwards he added,
If you will have me see them I will make Use of your Leave; and if you
refuse it, will imbark without seeing them. <i>Villagra</i> would not
allow of such rigid Nicety, pressing him to take the Satisfaction of
his Family, before the Act of Possession, and in the mean while,
stay&rsquo;d himself with <i>John de Vega</i>, and <i>Antony de
Sylva</i>.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>His Noble Entertainment.</i></span> As
soon as the <i>Sangiack</i> came Home, he sent the Captain about 30
<i>Indians</i> loaded with Provisions, one after another, but first
they brought Tables, Chairs; and Table-Linnen in their great Dishes,
and Salvers, and on them the Salts, Knives, drinking Cups, and Ewres,
Variety of Fruit, Pullets roasted and fry&rsquo;d, Goats Flesh roasted
and boil&rsquo;d, and other Dishes, after the Fashion of their Country.
A little before the Dinner was ended they brought a Bed, and Pillows of
green Satin, which they laid upon Carpets, to take an Afternoons Nap
on. It was not long before the <i>Sangiack</i> himself came,
follow&rsquo;d by all the People, leading his Mother, and <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Arms deliver&rsquo;d.</i></span> with them many Men
loaded with the Arms he was to deliver up, gather&rsquo;d from Private
Men, as also Drakes, Muskets, and other Fire-Arms. <i>Indians</i>
brought them on their Shoulders, adorn&rsquo;d with Boughs, in Token of
the Satisfaction they had in delivering them. The same was then done in
the Fort, as had been in the others. The <i>Sangiack</i> that Night
gave the Captain a Supper in the same Manner as the Dinner had been.
The next Day they breakfasted, and imbarking, return&rsquo;d where
<i>Gallinato</i> waited for them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253"

that when they came to <i>Sabubu</i>, they would endeavour to have the
Galleys come into the River, the Bar being proper for them, and having
1500 Men in Ambush, on both Sides of it, they would at Night send down
some Fire-Ships upon them, then those that were in Ambush giving the
Alarm, they might at least rescue their King, and the other Prisoners
that were aboard; and in Case the <i>Spaniards</i> would not go in with
their Galleys, they would seize Captain <i>Villagra</i>, when he
landed, that the Governour might, in Exchange, for him deliver them the
King of <i>Ternate</i>. A <i>Portuguese</i> Woman, who retir&rsquo;d to
<i>Tacome</i>, flying from <i>Ternate</i> when it was taken, and
marry&rsquo;d to a Renegado, tho&rsquo; she was herself a Christian,
gave <i>Gallinato</i> <span class="marginnote"><i>A</i> Portuguese

Treachery. He took no Notice, but privately advis&rsquo;d
<i>Villagra</i> to pretend he was sick. The Natives of <i>Sabubu</i>,
again pressed for the Captain, that they might deliver him the Fort,
and <i>Gallinato</i> desiring him to make ready to go thither, he
excus&rsquo;d himself, alledging his Indisposition. <i>Vega</i> and
<i>Sylva</i>, and some other Officers, went without him, and did the
same Thing he could have done, avoiding the Danger of the Treason.</p>

some just Requests, and to others which depended on Courtesy, being
only Matter of Bounty, restor&rsquo;d several Towns, wrongfully taken.
These were bestow&rsquo;d on the Kings of <i>Tydore</i>, of
<i>Bachian</i>, and of <i>Sian</i>. The last of these, tho&rsquo; he
ought to have joyn&rsquo;d the Governour before the Expedition came

possess&rsquo;d of them in the Island of <i>Machian</i>. On <i>Cachil

<i>Bachian</i>, as also <i>Lucabata</i>, <i>Palomata</i>, and other
Towns. He gave <i>Ruy Pereyra</i>, the <i>Sangiack</i> of <i>Labua</i>,
a notable Christian, and the King of <i>Spain</i>&rsquo;s Subject, the

The great Hall in the Fort was hung with Silk, rich Canopys set up; the
Governour <span class="marginnote"><i>Solemnity for swearing

Forces being at Arms; and then he declar&rsquo;d to the Kings the
Occasion of assembling them together, which was to swear Fealty to his
Majesty, a Duty that had been so long put off, and at the same Time so
much labour&rsquo;d for by War.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Persons that swore Fealty.</i></span>
They swore Fealty to our Sovereign Lord King <i>Philip</i>, in the
Person of the Governour <i>Don Pedro</i>. The first was <i>Cachil
Sultan Zayde Buxey</i>, King of <i>Ternate</i>, and <i>Cachil Sulamp
Gariolano</i>, the Prince, his Son. Then <i>Cachil Mole</i>, King of
<i>Tydore</i>; <i>Cachil Raxa Laudin</i>, King of <i>Bachian</i>;
<i>Cachil Dini</i>, King of <i>Sian</i>, who had never done it before,
but only profess&rsquo;d Friendship. After them swore the
<i>Sangiacks</i> and <i>Cachiles</i>, <i>Tulo</i>, <i>Codate</i>,
<i>Amuxa</i>, <i>Rete</i>, <i>Ale</i>, <i>Nayo</i>, <i>Quipate</i>,
<i>Colambaboa</i>, <i>Dexebes</i>, <i>Pamuza</i>, <i>Babada</i>,
<i>Barcat</i>, <i>Sugi</i>, <i>Gugu</i>, <i>Boleyfe</i>, <i>Gulila</i>,
<i>Maleyto</i>, <i>Banaba</i>, all of them Princes, Kinsmen, and
Subjects to the <i>Molucco</i> King. They promis&rsquo;d not to admit
of the <i>Dutch</i>, nor any other Nations, to the Trade of Clove, and
to preserve it entirely for his Majesty, and his Subjects; and to be
assisting with their Persons, Forces, and Ships, whensoever they should
be call&rsquo;d upon by the Commander of the Fort of <i>Ternate</i>, or
of the <i>Philippines</i>. It was also agreed, that they should not any
Way obstruct the Conversion of the Gentils that were inclin&rsquo;d to
embrace Christianity.</p>
<p>They were all satisfy&rsquo;d with this Beginning of their new
Subjection, because the King of <i>Ternate</i> oppress&rsquo;d them, as
being the most potent, and supported by the <i>Dutch</i>; nor had they
any Security against his Tyranny; especially since he caus&rsquo;d the
King of <i>Tydore</i>&rsquo;s Father to be treacherously
murder&rsquo;d, <span class="marginnote"><i>Another Fort built at</i>

War, and a Kinsman of his, which they both still resented. Don Pedro
order&rsquo;d another Fort to be erected at <i>Tydore</i>, and a
Captain with 50 Men to Garrison it; at the Request of the King, by
whose Assistance it was finish&rsquo;d. It was resolv&rsquo;d, that for
the present, the <span class="marginnote">Ternate <i>eas&rsquo;d of
Duties.</i></span> third Part of the Duties the People of
<i>Ternate</i> us&rsquo;d to pay, should be taken off, so to make them
easy, that they might reap some Benefit of our Victory, and not be
perswaded it tended to increase their Oppression. The old Fort being
small, and unfit to make any considerable Defence, it was thought fit
to build one on a higher Ground, larger, and stronger. The Plan was
laid out, and Orders given for carrying on the Work. The said old Fort
was brought into a narrow Compass, whilst the new one was raising,
which the Governour, before he departed <i>Ternate</i>, saw
finish&rsquo;d, quite enclos&rsquo;d, and strengthned with Ramparts.
Six hundred Men, distributed into six Companies, <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Men left at</i> Ternate.</span> were left in it, to
defend the Island against any Invasion. Six other Captains were
reform&rsquo;d. There were also twelve Gunners, 65 Pioneers, 35 Masons,
and two good Brigantines, which, in Case of Necessity, <span class=

Colonel <i>John de Esquivel</i> was appointed Commander in chief, and
Governour of all the <i>Moluccos</i>.</p>
<p><i>Don Pedro</i>, the Day before his Departure, gave the said
Governour his Instructions, which had been maturely weighed, and
debated, after several private Conferences with him, providing for all
Accidents that might happen.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Prisoners shipp&rsquo;d for</i>
Manila.</span> All the Prisoners, being the King and Prince of
<i>Ternate</i>, and 24 <i>Sangiacks</i> and <i>Cachiles</i>, were put
aboard the Admiral Galley, under the Care of Captain <i>Villagra</i>,
with particular Orders to convey them to <i>Manila</i>. This done they
set sail. Our Fleet being departed with the Booty, and Prisoners, the
Colonel, <i>John de Esquivel</i>, apply&rsquo;d himself diligently to
the Affairs of his Charge, and to hastning on the Fortifications begun
in several Parts. Whilst the Conquerors <span class=
"marginnote"><i>King of</i> Tydore <i>sent to</i> Sabubu.</span>
sail&rsquo;d away, on the fourth of <i>May</i>, he order&rsquo;d the
King of <i>Tydore</i>, with his Fleet, and in it some <i>Spaniards</i>,
commanded by the Captains <i>Pasqual de Aragon</i>, and <i>Martin de
Esquivel</i>, to sail for <i>Sabubu</i>, to perswade the
<i>Cachiles</i>, <i>Sugui</i> and <i>Quipati</i>, to return to the
City; because by their Examples the Citizens and Multitude would do the
like, they being fled to the Mountains on Account of the War; for so
they would quit those Deserts, be encouraged to confide in the
Conqueror, and settle in Peace. The King of <i>Tydore</i> arriv&rsquo;d
at <i>Sabubu</i>, with his Company; sent Messengers to them, who
deliver&rsquo;d what they were commission&rsquo;d with, adding, that if
they requir&rsquo;d Hostages for their safe coming, they should have
the <i>Spanish</i> Captains that were <span class="marginnote"><i>The
Governours refuse to come.</i></span> in the Fleet deliver&rsquo;d to
them. The Governours were so far from giving Ear to their Message, that
they sent to conjure them to depart <i>Sabubu</i>. <i>Esquivel</i> was
concern&rsquo;d at this mistrustful and rough Behaviour, because the
greatest Part of the People of the Island were in that strong Hold, and
in <i>Gilolo</i>, and that Repulse in the Presence of the Natives that
were fled, seem&rsquo;d to threaten greater Opposition. Whilst he
prepar&rsquo;d to reduce them, he endeavour&rsquo;d by fair Means to
attract the Inhabitants of a Town, call&rsquo;d <i>Tacome</i>, two
Leagues from <i>Ternate</i>, whither also some of those that had fled
were retir&rsquo;d. He sent them a considerable Quantity of Plunder,
plac&rsquo;d Safeguards in <i>Tacome</i> and <i>Malayo</i>, to quiet,
and defend them against the <i>Tydores</i>, their Enemies and
Conquerors.</p>
<p>The King of <i>Tydore</i>, and our Commanders, returning without any
Effect <span class="marginnote">Spanish <i>Ships at</i> Machian.</span>
from <i>Sabubu</i>, they sail&rsquo;d with the Fleet to <i>Machian</i>,
to recover peaceably that Part of the Island, which the Governour,
<i>Don Pedro</i>, took from the King <span class=
"marginnote"><i>two</i> Dutch <i>Ships.</i></span> of <i>Ternate</i>,
to restore it to him of <i>Tydore</i>. At the same Time two
<i>Dutch</i> Ships arriv&rsquo;d there; one of them was the same our
Fleet found some Days before in the Fort <i>Talangame</i>; which having
been a Witness to our Success, rejoyn&rsquo;d the other, and both of
them came together to the <i>Moluccos</i>, by Order of the <i>Dutch</i>
Commander residing at <i>Amboyna</i>, to encourage the King of
<i>Ternate</i> to persist in his Disobedience, and assist him against
our Fleet. Our Men sent the Colonel Advice, who order&rsquo;d our
Galliots to set out, to find, and pursue those Ships, that so their
Boats might not offer to move far from them, and to endeavour to
obstruct their trading with the Natives. Tho&rsquo; the Orders were
obey&rsquo;d, the said two Ships appear&rsquo;d before <i>Ternate</i>
the third Day after, and holding on their Course, anchor&rsquo;d at
<i>Gilolo</i>, where most of the Natives of the <i>Molucco</i> Islands,
who were fled, had fortify&rsquo;d themselves. These Guests, according
to their Custome, call&rsquo;d together all <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name="pb256">256</a>]</span>the
Inhabitants, who were dispers&rsquo;d about in other Towns, and
resolv&rsquo;d to go over to <i>Gilolo</i> and <i>Sabubu</i>. They
gather&rsquo;d all their Vessels, and thought, with them, and the
<i>Dutch</i> Ships, to obstruct the Ravage our Galiots made, and to
support their Friends. This new Rebellion was carryed on in Sight of
the <i>Dutch</i> Ships lying at Anchor before <i>Gilolo</i>, and they
secur&rsquo;d, and defended them against our Squadrons.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Rebellion at</i> Gilolo<span class=
"corr" id="xd21e30933" title="Not in source">.</span></span> The
Colonel intreated the King of <i>Tydore</i>, who was newly
return&rsquo;d from <i>Machian</i>, to gather a greater Number of
arm&rsquo;d <i>Carcoas</i>, that our Infantry might be carry&rsquo;d in
them, and the Galiots, to attack <i>Gilolo</i>, and <i>Sabubu</i>, in
Order to suppress that Mischief in its first Rise, there being other
Places for our Vessels to put into, besides the Harbour where the
Enemies Ships lay at Anchor. The King of <i>Tydore</i> started so many
Difficulties, that <i>Esquivel</i> could not prevail upon him. Another
more effectual Method was found. <span class="marginnote"><i>Methods
for suppressing it</i><span class="corr" id="xd21e30961" title=
"Not in source">.</span></span> It being certain, that the Fugitives
must bring their Provisions, and particularly Rice, from the Province
<i>del Moro</i>, and Island of <i>Moratay</i>, where there is great
Plenty; and that we having burnt the Ships of the <i>Moluccos</i>,
during that War, they would supply the Want of them from those same
Places; the Governour therefore resolv&rsquo;d, that Major
<i>Vergara</i>, and the King of <i>Tydore</i>, should repair thither
with 120 <i>Spaniards</i>, to disappoint their Designs, that so
Necessity might reduce them to submit.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">120 Spaniards <i>sent to</i> Gilolo.</span>
Our Forces arriv&rsquo;d at the Island <i>Batochina</i>, which is the
same as <i>Gilolo</i>, and where <i>Sabubu</i> stands. Leaving the
Shore, they march&rsquo;d over extraordinary wooded Mountains, along
the Side of the River <i>Gabocanora</i>, to a great Town, the
Receptacle of many of the Fugitives. They met with no Opposition, or
other Obstacle in the Way, but only those sharp pointed Stakes they use
to drive into the Ground. The Enemy had plac&rsquo;d their greatest
Defence upon the River; but abandon&rsquo;d it upon the Approach of the
<i>Spaniards</i>, running up into the Mountains, and leaving their
Houses <span class="marginnote"><i>They burn Towns and reduce the
Island.</i></span> and Vessels. Our Men fell upon both, burnt them, and
took such as durst stay behind. In fine, they all, dismay&rsquo;d at
the Sight of the Flames and Destruction, embrac&rsquo;d more submissive
methods. The City <i>Visoa</i> underwent the same Fate, and the Remains
of it sued for Pardon, and comply&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>The King of <i>Tydore</i> went away from this Place with eight
<i>Carcoas</i>, leaving the rest, and the Galleys, with the Major. The
City <i>Mamuya</i>, having <span class="marginnote">Galela
<i>destroy&rsquo;d.</i></span> made Resistance, was also burnt. Our Men
went over in small Vessels to <i>Galela</i>, a Town built in a large
Lake, which held out till reduc&rsquo;d by Fire and Sword, the very
Children swimming away. <i>Tolo</i>, <i>Chiava</i>, and <i>Camafo</i>,

which are three Leagues from <i>Galela</i>, and whose Inhabitants had
been formerly Christians, prevented Military Execution, by sending
Deputies from <i>Tolo</i>, the strongest of them, with Boughs of
<i>Bonanas</i> in Blossom, and Green, and White Cloves. They came
unarm&rsquo;d, and with Musick, and express&rsquo;d much Sorrow for
their late Rebellion, for which <i>Sultan Zayde</i> was to blame, and
for having forsaken the Christian Religion, which they were there ready
to imbrace. The <i>Spanish</i> Commander prais&rsquo;d, and treated
them Courteously. Our Men now sickned a pace; for which Reason, as also
because the westerly Winds began to grow boisterous, he was
oblig&rsquo;d to defer the subduing of <i>Moratay</i>. However he left
some Men at <i>Tolo</i>, with the small Guns taken at
<i>Gabocanora</i>, to secure the Towns that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257" name="pb257">257</a>]</span>were
reduc&rsquo;d, and defend them against those of <i>Galela</i> and
<i>Tabelo</i>, which are biger than they. This done he return&rsquo;d
to <i>Ternate</i>, but not without Storms, and Dangers, incurr&rsquo;d
by giving Credit to a <i>Molucco</i> Slave.</p>
<p>The Governour mann&rsquo;d a Galliot, a Brigantine, and some smaller
Vessels with Soldiers, and <i>Chineses</i> to row, under the Command of
the Ensign <i>Christopher Suarez</i>. He sail&rsquo;d with a fair Wind
for the Island <i>Mateo</i>, <span class="marginnote"><i>Message
from</i> Esquivel <i>to the Heathen Kings of</i> Bool, <i>and</i>

is 30 Leagues West from <i>Ternate</i>, and its Length above 150
Leagues. The furthest Part of it is subject to the King of
<i>Macassar</i>, a <i>Mahometan</i> Prince, with whom the People of
<i>Malaca</i> have Trade, as also with three other heathen Kings, of
whom there was a Report, that they desired to be Christians; but they
fell under the Tyranny of the King of <i>Ternate</i>, and
suffer&rsquo;d by his Invasions and Burnings. <i>Esquivel</i> sent to
acquaint them with the King of <i>Spain</i>&rsquo;s Victories and
Success; and exhorted them to come under his Dominion, but above all to
be united to the Church. He made them Presents of <i>European</i>
Commodities, which are as good as Money with them, and offer&rsquo;d
the Protection of the <i>Spanish</i> Power, which had pull&rsquo;d down
that Tyrant, to whom they were Tributary. He said, he sent them Ships
and Arms, and that for the Time to come, they might safely repair to
trade at the <i>Moluccos</i>. These Princes were two Brothers, the one
King of <i>Bool</i>, the other of <i>Totoli</i>. They rejoyc&rsquo;d at
the coming of the Embassador <i>Christopher Suarez</i>, and he
presenting them some Pieces of Velvet, in Token of Friendship, they
return&rsquo;d other Gifts, and Abundance of Provisions, and
dismiss&rsquo;d him, with a Letter to the Governour. Queen
<i>Dongue</i> of <i>Cauripa</i>, testify&rsquo;d to <i>Esquivel</i> no
less Satisfaction, and Inclination to be united to the King of
<i>Spain</i> by Vassalage.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>King of</i> Tydore<i>&rsquo;s
Actions.</i></span> The Garrisons of the Rebellious Towns were
assaulted by the <i>Spaniards</i>, and compell&rsquo;d to submit. The
King of <i>Tydore</i> made Havock on the Coast of <i>Batochina</i>, or
<i>Gilolo</i>, where he recover&rsquo;d for his Majesty, and for
himself, the Towns and Forts that had been taken from him by the King
of <i>Ternate</i>. He plunder&rsquo;d the great Town of <i>Mira</i>, in
<i>Moratay</i>, and made Captives of many that oppos&rsquo;d him, who
had also been Christians. Among the rest he took a <i>Guimala</i>,
which signifies, a Chief, or Head of a Quarter, or Ward, whom he again
set at Liberty, at the Request of our Men, sending him away with two
other <i>Guimalas</i>, in the Company of Captain <i>John</i>
<span class="marginnote">Meaos <i>Islands subdu&rsquo;d.</i></span>
<i>de la Torre</i>. The Islands in those Parts were reducing by
Degrees, with little Opposition. Those of the <i>Meaos</i>, lying to

Towns, defended themselves, with the Assistance, and Industry of the
<i>Dutch</i>; but <i>B. Antony Flores</i>, a Lay-Brother, of the Order
of S. <i>Augustin</i>, who fought against the <i>Sangleyes</i> of
<i>Manila</i>, as has been said above, coming thither with the Galleys,
they submitted. The Ensign <i>Lewis de Zuazo</i> arriv&rsquo;d after
the Business was over, and they being now successful, and understanding
that the <i>Dutch</i> Ship was sail&rsquo;d from <i>Gilolo</i>, made
after her. She was so good a Sailer, <span class=
"marginnote"><i>Reduction of other Islands.</i></span> that they
labour&rsquo;d in vain; but carry&rsquo;d on the War at <i>Gilolo</i>
and <i>Sabubu</i>, which made the <i>Ternate</i> Governours put up
their Complaints, and lay aside their Designs. They writ to the
Governour, and he answer&rsquo;d them, sending a Copy of the Articles,
upon which they offer&rsquo;d to repair to <i>Ternate</i>, in peaceable
Manner. All our Commanders were dispers&rsquo;d in several <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258" name=
"pb258">258</a>]</span>Places, reducing the Islands of the
<i>Moluccos</i> that had Rebell&rsquo;d, either by Force of Arms, or
other Methods; and particularly those belonging to the <i>Sultan</i> of
<i>Ternate</i>, which are few under an hundred; and thus Peace began to
be establish&rsquo;d, which if not Wish&rsquo;d for, was at least
Tolerated, and accepted of with such Appearances as are becoming to
make it honourable.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The King and</i> Molucco <i>Prisoners

submitted by Force to receive the Yoke, the Governour, <i>Don Pedro de

at a Distance from the Fleet, with the King, Prince, and
<i>Sangiacks</i> that were Prisoners, aboard the Admiral Galley. This
made them form a Design to attempt to make their Escape to
<i>Mindanao</i>, and they had succeeded, if not prevented by the
Soldiers that guarded them. Captain <i>Villagra</i> either Suspected,
or had Information of it, and therefore doubled the Guards, and put
eight of the most daring into Chains. Among the most remarkable were
<i>Cachil Amuxa</i>, the <i>Sangiack Rete</i>, and he of
<i>Mofaquia</i>. They all arriv&rsquo;d at <i>Manila</i>, but their
Fetters were taken off before they came thither, after they had worn
them ten Days, with much Regret of the King, whom they satisfy&rsquo;d
with Hopes, and acquainting him with some of the Grounds there were to
suspect, till the Danger of laying them aside ceas&rsquo;d. The Hazard
at <i>Mindanao</i> was, that those Islands are not Tributary, yet they
value themselves upon entertaining Friendship with the King of
<i>Ternate</i>; and it is most certain, that had he attempted to fly,
and succeeded in it, they would have supported him there, and
<i>Villagra</i> had Intelligence given him, that the King either made,
or approv&rsquo;d of the Proposal; tho&rsquo; there was no want of Care
and Vigilancy either in <i>Don Pedro</i>&rsquo;s Ship, or the Admiral
Galley.</p>
<p>During all this Time we have spoken of, the News of our Success was
not brought to the <i>Philippine</i> Islands. This long Silence, and
Want of Intelligence, became an Argument in those Parts, and
particularly at <i>Manila</i>, that <i>Don Pedro</i> and the Fleet were
lost, or at least had met with such <span class="marginnote">Don Pedro
de Acunna <i>suppos&rsquo;d to be poison&rsquo;d.</i></span> ill
Success as deserv&rsquo;d to be generally lamented. Virtue never
fail&rsquo;d of envious Persons to persecute it, and accordingly <i>Don

were well known, in so much that in the general Opinion of all Men,
they are suppos&rsquo;d to have given the Poison, whereof that great
Man was thought to have dy&rsquo;d 22 Days after his Return, we will
nevertheless suppress their Names, since it is not the Part of an
Author, whose Duty it is to observe an exact Neutrality, and not to be
led any Way by Affection, to confirm that Deposition, which, as yet, is
no better grounded than on Suspicion. They are all Dead long since,
<span class="marginnote"><i>False Reports abroad.</i></span> and have
been try&rsquo;d before that great Tribunal, where the least thought
cannot pass without being accounted for. These Men gave out, That
<i>Don Pedro</i> attacking <i>Ternate</i>, enter&rsquo;d it
successfully; but that his Men had been too intent upon Plunder, the
Enemy rallyed, and falling upon the <i>Spaniards</i>, beat them out
again, killing most of them. And that the General being asham&rsquo;d
of his ill Conduct, durst not return to <i>Manila</i>.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Indians begin to Mutiny.</i></span> This

they said, That since the People <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb259"
href="#pb259" name="pb259">259</a>]</span>of the <i>Moluccos</i> were
victorious, why should they be still subject to the <i>Spaniards</i>,
who did not defend them against the <i>Moors</i>, and these would now
plunder them daily with the Assistance of <i>Ternate</i>, and it would
be worse for the Future. Nor were they satisfy&rsquo;d with muttering,
but proceeded to confer Notes together, and to contrive putting their
Projects in Execution. But all this vanish&rsquo;d at the Sight of
Truth, and the News of it, brought in before the Arrival of the
Conquerors, and the Preparations they saw made for their Reception, and
triumphant Rejoycings. The Weather was seasonable, and favour&rsquo;d
them in all Respects, and they arriv&rsquo;d at <i>Manila</i> on the
ninth of <i>June</i>, loaded with Honour and Victory, after they had
rested in the Port of <i>Cabite</i>, two Leagues distant.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Prisoners disconsolate.</i></span> The
Captives diverted themselves with our Men, to put off the Remembrance
of past Times, whilst rich Garments of several Sorts of Silks were
provided for them at the Publick Charge, which is the King&rsquo;s
Treasury in the <i>Philippine</i> Islands. They look&rsquo;d
dejectedly, and with Admiration, on the Harbour, Walls, Forts, and
Buildings of the City, the Sight whereof made them call to Mind the
last Day on which they fell from their boasted State of Liberty. Our
Commanders dropt some courteous Words of Comfort in their Discourse,
telling them, that as soon as the News could come to <i>Spain</i> of
their being reduc&rsquo;d, and that good Order was taken against
falling again into the former Dangers, the King would order them to be
restor&rsquo;d to their Liberty. All these Expressions were not of
Force to satisfy those <i>Indians</i>, who on the contrary began to
complain of the General, because they either suspected, or were told by
some of our Men, that he would not observe the safe Conduct, and
promise he had made them in the King&rsquo;s Name, and on which they
had rely&rsquo;d; and that in Case <i>Sultan Zayde</i> were
continu&rsquo;d in the <i>Philippine</i> Islands, it was certain they
would send his Son, Prince <i>Gariolano</i> into <i>Europe</i>, by the
Way of <i>New Spain</i>. The general being acquainted with these
melancholly Reflections of theirs, thought it concern&rsquo;d the
Reputation of the Christian Religion in general, and of the
<i>Spanish</i> Nation in particular, to dispell those Jealousies, and
therefore he writ to them, and directed the Captain, who carry&rsquo;d
the Letters, to perswade the King not to conceive the least Mistrust of
the King&rsquo;s Word, and Security he had confided in. This
compos&rsquo;d their Thoughts, and they either did, or pretended to
take Comfort.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Don Pedro<i>&rsquo;s Entry into</i>
Manila.</span> The Prisoners came with the Forces to the City, which
the Fleet saluted with its Cannon, and were answer&rsquo;d by the
Artillery and small Shot from the Walls and Forts. The King landed in a
Garden the Governor had without the Walls, where he repos&rsquo;d
himself that Night, and when Lodgings were provided for him, with the
greatest State that could be, and answerably for other Prisoners,
according to their Qualities, <i>Don Pedro</i> enter&rsquo;d
<i>Manila</i> with the Forces, and Ostentation of Captives and Booty.
There wanted not Triumphal Arches, with such Inscriptions as are
Generally <span class="marginnote"><i>Description of the King of</i>
Ternate.</span> set on them in Honour of Conquerors. The Habit of the
Prisoners, in rich Mantles, Turbants and Plumes, was not sutable to
their Fortune; as making their Countenances look more haughty, and
representing Arrogancy. That King was strong body&rsquo;d, and his
Limbs well Knit; his Neck, and great Part of his Arms he wore naked;
his Skin being of the Color of a Cloud, rather inclin&rsquo;d to Black
than Tawny. The Features of his Face were like <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name="pb260">260</a>]</span>an
<i>European</i>. His Eyes large, full, and sparkling, to which they add
the Fierceness of long Eyebrows, thick Beards and Whiskers, and lank
Hair. He always wore his <i>Campilane</i>, or Cimiter, and <i>Criz</i>,
or Dagger; the Hilts of them both resembling the Heads of Snakes gilt.
This is affirm&rsquo;d by Officers that attended, and convers&rsquo;d
with him familiarly, to whom he was obligingly Courteous, and it
appears by Relations, and by the Picture drawn to the Life, which the
General sent into <i>Spain</i> for the King.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Rejoycings</i><span class="corr" id=
"xd21e31483" title="Not in source">.</span></span> The Rejoycings for
the Victory were continu&rsquo;d with much Solemnity, the
<i>Indians</i>, who were the principal Subject of them, being present.
The King of <i>Ternate</i> understanding that Messengers were sending
away to <i>Spain</i> to carry the News of the Success, and Account of
the Prisoners, writ a short Letter to the King, intermixt with
Commendations of <i>Don Pedro de Acunna</i> and some other
<i>Spanish</i> Commanders. He represented the change of his Condition,
with somewhat of Submission, but not Humility, or rather Meanness; and
intreated his Majesty to extend his Royal Goodness towards the
Conquer&rsquo;d, for his own Magnanimity&rsquo;s sake, and on Account
of the perpetual Fidelity, and Vassalage they had sworn to him. This
Letter was writ by another Hand, and in <i>Spanish</i>. When it was
given him to sign, the King turn&rsquo;d the upside down, and Writ his
Name on the white half Page in <i>Persian</i> Characters, thinking he
had sign&rsquo;d at the Beginning, or Top of the Letter, as is
practis&rsquo;d by the Princes of those Countries. The <i>Moluccos</i>
being Reduc&rsquo;d, our Ministers and Preachers went over thither, and
the Voice of the Gospel resounded again in the utmost Borders of the
Earth.</p>
